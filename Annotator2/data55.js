If you look through highlights from Nuggets games a lot of his passes are either directed towards cutters at the rim or the perimeter for an open 3 bc his incredible post moves command double teams a lot of the time - his mere presence raises the shooting percentages of everyone on the floor, which is why he's an advanced stats darling (same with Curry, it's not just his production - it's his impact on everyone else). \n\nAlso note that before Jokic came along, Barton and Harris were nothing like the players they are now (Harris had come off a historically bad rookie season and was already being labelled a bust, whereas Barton had bounced around the league without any success and was given up by Portland for nothing). Also not sure why you're bringing up Nurk and Plumlee when they've both played poorly in Denver, and that the prior was playing so poorly backing up Jokic that the front office felt the need to give up a first rounder to offload him.\n\nI appreciate that Cousins hasn't had much help, and I'm not saying he isn't an incredible player - on the other hand, if Jokic was on that team they would be doing better than they are, simply thanks to the impact of his passing alone creating quality looks (compare that to Cousins who averages 5 turnovers a game this season). Unfortunately Cousins doesn't make his teammates better the way Jokic can, but then no other center in the league does, at least on the offensive end. I do think advanced stats overrate him a bit defensively because the scheme is designed to minimise his weaknesses as a defender (rim protection, one-on-one, defending the perimeter).\n\nAlso, playing 28 minutes a game is not a small enough amount to argue that it doesn't qualify as a big enough sample size. Those are starter minutes, not some case like Boban Marjanovic on the Spurs where he was playing about 9 minutes and absolutely destroying the opposition - Jokic is doing that for 28 minutes a night, and nearly 30 this season."}, {"id": "dquw0v0", "body": "Jokic makes them more efficient with his passing though. If you look through highlights from Nuggets games a lot of his passes are either directed towards cutters at the rim or the perimeter for an open 3 bc his incredible post moves command double teams a lot of the time - his mere presence raises the shooting percentages of everyone on the floor, which is why he's an advanced stats darling (same with Curry, it's not just his production - it's his impact on everyone else). \n\nAlso note that before Jokic came along, Barton and Harris were nothing like the players they are now (Harris had come off a historically bad rookie season and was already being labelled a bust, whereas Barton had bounced around the league without any success and was given up by Portland for nothing). Also not sure why you're bringing up Nurk and Plumlee when they've both played poorly in Denver, and that the prior was playing so poorly backing up Jokic that the front office felt the need to give up a first rounder to offload him.\n\nI appreciate that Cousins hasn't had much help, and I'm not saying he isn't an incredible player - on the other hand, if Jokic was on that team they would be doing better than they are, simply thanks to the impact of his passing alone creating quality looks (compare that to Cousins who averages 5 turnovers a game this season). Unfortunately Cousins doesn't make his teammates better the way Jokic can, but then no other center in the league does, at least on the offensive end.

Now do that trying to guard NBA players. Jokic's cardio is questionable. \n\n&gt;Also he averaged 28 mpg over the whole season not just part of it.\n\nOnce again this is just factually wrong. In the beginning of last season he was coming off the bench and he certainly wasn't playing 28 mpg at that time.\n\n&gt;Jokic often turns down the chance to score himself to set his teammates up. \n\nCousins is averaging more assists. The higher turnover ratio is due to actually being in games more and taking more shots. Hence better offensive player.  \n\nAlso there's two sides of the ball. Cousins is solid defensively and Jokic isn't really half the defender that Cousins is. He looks lost in the pick and roll - he has alligator arms and he can't guard the perimeter. You might be a stud on offense but if you're getting lit up then you're hindering your team. \n\nEither way I've already established Cousins being better offensively. Jokic is one of the most overrated players in this sub. Y'all take small sample sizes on low MPG and make it seem like he's not just a poor mans Marc Gasol currently. He's nowhere near a superstar.\n\nAlso they weren't the best offense. They scored the most points hence ORTG. This is because they play half of their games at home and Denver is at high altitude.

This year's LeBron is simply terrifying (I still shudder from Game 7) and if given a few more pieces can definitely make a serious run to dethrone my Warriors. We all know what DeAndre can provide: length, hustle, and an imposing presence inside the paint. He can be a legitimate defensive anchor for the Cavs and potentially deter open rim-runs from KD. He can even catch lobs for days from LeBron. Not to mention he's not even dating a Kardashian! George Hill is unhappy in Sacramento and being on a contender again will certainly prop his spirits back up. He provides the Cavs with good defense, shooting, and can act as another ball handler if necessary.
