The team are 27th out of 30 in FG%, 3PT%, and FT%, respectively, all hallmarks of inefficiency. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony have been number one scoring options for much of their careers, so combining them with a historic Usage Rate player in Russell Westbrook has made for an awkward adjustment period during the first portion of their tenure together. The three currently average 53 of the team\u2019s 85.7 Field Goal Attempts per game, or 61.8%, one of the highest marks in the league. However, PG-13, Russ and Melo only average 61.7 of the team\u2019s 102 PTS, a 60.5% mark, meaning they are *below* the rest of the team\u2019s efficiency level. This is incredible for many reasons, especially considering the general perception of the team as being extremely top heavy. \n\n\nThe threesome\u2019s unfamiliarity and lack of synergy has been evident: too many possessions begin and end with one of the players taking a contested mid to long range jumper with zero passes. OKC are currently 25th in the NBA in Assists, nearly 10 less per game than #1 Golden State. The ball simply stops. There\u2019s no sugar coating it, from an offensive standpoint, it\u2019s been ugly thus far. PG-13, Russ and Melo must share the ball more for the offense to operate as something resembling a contending unit. It\u2019s perplexing that so much collective talent has led to such mediocre results. \n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still early in the season. Despite their offensive struggles, there are signs that OKC are not as mediocre as their record would indicate. The team\u2019s expected (Pythagorean) Win-Loss based on Points For and Against is a reasonable [14-9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2018.html). The Thunder are 3-9 in games decided by 8 points or less (all three wins coming during their current winning streak), a mark sure to reverse and normalize over time. They possess the 4th ranked defense in the league, led by standouts George and Andre Roberson, two of the best wing defenders in the business. There are reasons to be concerned, but it\u2019s likely the Thunder will improve over time. It would be the biggest shock of the season if they did not make the playoffs, but that is largely immaterial. What really matters is their seeding: if they are one of the bottom three seeds in the Western Conference playoffs, OKC will likely have to play one of GSW, HOU or SAS in the first round, meaning they will have to go through at minimum two of those teams to make the NBA Finals, a near impossible task \u2013 one they nearly pulled off in 2016 (albeit with a much different roster; only the core of Westbrook/Roberson/Adams remain of the regulars).\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nA Few Key Points and then Possible Solutions\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Paul George](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html) is the most efficient scorer of the \u201cbig three.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge is 27, just entering his \u201cprime\u201d (typically thought to be between ages 27-32). [Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html) is 29. [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) is 33. Head to head comparisons this season (FG%/3PT%/FT%):\n\n\nPG-13: 42/41/82 (54 True, 56 Career)\n\nRuss: 40/32/72 (50 True, 53 Career)\n\nMelo: 42/35/81 (52 True, 54 Career)\n\n\nClearly, none have been stellar, aside from George\u2019s 3PT%. It\u2019s also worth noting that Carmelo has more than **10 times** as many shots as assists for the season (354 to 35). A legitimate case can be made that Paul George is the most complete and valuable player of the three: he\u2019s the best shooter, the youngest, and an incomparably superior defender. Westbrook doesn\u2019t try on D most of the time, he just gambles for steals (OKC is 2nd in the NBA in steals) and crashes the boards (something he does exceptionally well, but still). That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s incapable of guarding, he just doesn\u2019t try. Carmelo never used to either, but he\u2019s giving more effort now. The problem is, he\u2019s older and not good at it. \n\n\nFurther, OKC is 4-0 when PG-13 scores 28+ points. When Westbrook or Anthony score 28+? A combined 4-4. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Paul George is a Free Agent at the end of the season.\n\n\nIf the Thunder want to keep the Westbrook and PG-13 duo together long-term, it would be wise to keep George happy. It\u2019s no secret that he has a preference for the Los Angeles Lakers, and though they already have multiple 6\u20199\u201d+ forwards, George is versatile enough to play SG and would immediately become the best player on the team. However, after adding Anthony, PG-13 seemed to backtrack and throw his (notoriously tepid) support behind OKC. Westbrook [signed his supermax extension, per Woj](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/913845317115744257), at the end of September, so they no longer have to worry about him short-term. They\u2019ve already made him the \u201cman.\u201d Melo is far less crucial to the Thunder\u2019s long-term success, as both his [statistical profile](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) and age suggest that he has been in a slow, steady decline the past handful of years (FG% has dropped each of the past five seasons; he has an early termination option for a hair under $28 million next season, so he's unlikely to bail).\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* The team wins more when Westbrook shoots less.\n\n\n[OKC is 7-2 in games that Westbrook takes less than 19 shots. When he takes 19 or more? 4-10.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2018) He currently leads the team with an average of 19.6 shots per game.\n\n\nThis is not just true for this season, but in years past as well. OKC had far more team success when Westbrook was the #2 option behind Kevin Durant. Westbrook\u2019s usage rate skyrocketed when Durant was injured three years ago and gone as a FA last season, but the team\u2019s record was decidedly worse both seasons. True, this is partially due to the enormous skill disparity between KD and his replacements, but the Thunder simply play better when Westbrook operates more as a facilitator and less of a Kobe impersonator.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Steven Adams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html) is having a career year - he needs to, because he\u2019s getting paid $100 million (pre- taxes) over the next four seasons. \n\n\nAdams is a very good player who has shown marked improvement from his days as a raw, brutish rookie. He has consistently and continuously upgraded his game each off-season, adding new wrinkles to his repertoire, and this has been no different. Steven\u2019s scoring a career high 13.5 PPG on career highs in efficiency across the board (65 FG%, 69 FT%, 67% True). He possesses a unique mixture of strength, size, toughness, agility, athleticism and soft touch for a true Center. He\u2019s an above average defensive player with both quick feet and hands. While not considered an elite 5, he is competitive with anyone in the league on a nightly basis.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* More two-man actions designed for Paul George and Steven Adams.\n\n\nThe two have shown good synergy in recent games, with George driving and finding Adams for bounce passes and lobs. Adams has excellent hands, regularly catching tough passes, and can finish with both. He has a knack for finding the soft spot in the defense and knocking people out of the way to hunt the ball when the opportunity arises. George possesses top notch ball handling skills for his size, although his decision making and timing can be questionable (not waiting for the big man to be set on Pick and Rolls, for example). Billy Donovan has run some of Kevin Durant\u2019s old sets (double high screens, pin down back-screens) for George and he\u2019s more than capable of executing them, especially with an enhanced role and comfort level.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Get Andre Roberson more involved\n\n\nYes, Roberson is a terrible foul shooter. Yes, his shot is quite ugly. Both of those things are true, but he\u2019s also a tremendous athlete with long arms and good leaping ability. Even if you just run backdoor screens and have him cut more for lobs he becomes more of a threat, as opposed to teams ignoring him entirely and OKC playing 4v5 on offense. Donovan, his staff, and the team need to get creative to find him more looks so opposing teams actually respect his ability to score a bucket.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Limit Anthony\u2019s minutes and possibly use him as a sixth man.\n\n\nDonovan started to go in this direction vs. Minnesota and San Antonio before increasing his minutes vs. Utah last night. Melo scoffed at the notion of [coming off the bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t7nRSezCHo) prior to the season, and reiterated his dislike for the idea prior to their recent winning streak. I personally think both he and the team would play better with the change, much like Dwyane Wade\u2019s success leading the Cavs second unit. George, Westbrook and Anthony all need the ball, but they can\u2019t all have it playing together at the same time. The numbers back it up: [the team is 7-2 (one DNP, a win) when Melo plays less than 31 minutes, 4-8 when he takes 17+ shots, and 6-10 when he scores 16+ points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01/gamelog/2018). The numbers also say that he should be more aggressive in driving and posting, because the team is 5-2 when he has 5+ Free Throw Attempts.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Russ needs to be a more active participant when he doesn\u2019t have the ball\n\n\nToo many times Westbrook can be spotted camping five feet behind the three-point line readying himself for a high degree of difficulty shot instead of moving without the ball. When the rest of the team sees their leader doing this, they\u2019re less likely to move around (like they should be) too. You can only pin so much blame on coaching when a player refuses to change. The thing is, this play style also leads to some spectacular offensive rebounds and steals: Russ acts like an innocent sheep, then flies in from out of nowhere, showing himself to be a wolf. It\u2019s not exactly technically sound, but it can be very entertaining.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall, I think the Thunder will be fine. I don\u2019t see the teams currently in the 4-8 spots as being significantly better than OKC in any way. OKC has multiple weaknesses and plenty of things to work on, but it\u2019s a long season, and talent usually prevails in the end. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they made another trade to increase their depth: Raymond Felton and Jerami Grant have both been solid off the bench, but Patrick Patterson has been abysmal and Alex Abrines is barely hanging onto his rotation spot.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: OKC\u2019s had a rough start to the season, but I think they\u2019ll improve as the season goes on. Their 21st ranked offense has been buoyed by their 4th ranked defense. To clearly define their roles and increase efficiency, the coaching staff should consider running more two-man actions with Paul George and Steven Adams, and possibly move Carmelo Anthony to the bench for a better fit. Westbrook is still the same player, he just doesn\u2019t feel the same freedom to do whatever he wanted like last season. They\u2019ll be fine to make the playoffs, but will be in trouble once they get there if things don\u2019t get better. \n\n\nEdit: few typos\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "dqusez2", "body": "its almost like WB is a shitty teammate and they thought giving him Melo would help.... weird"}, {"id": "dqusez2", "body": "its almost like WB is a shitty teammate and they thought giving him Melo would help.... weird"}, {"id": "dqutfpx", "body": "Nah"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hytq5", "body": "**Oklahoma City Thunder: 11 wins 12 losses, 9th in the Western Conference**\n\n\nThe Thunder have had a disappointing start to the 2017-18 season, in large part because their [21st ranked offense](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2018.html) has been a mess.

I personally think both he and the team would play better with the change, much like Dwyane Wade\u2019s success leading the Cavs second unit. George, Westbrook and Anthony all need the ball, but they can\u2019t all have it playing together at the same time. The numbers back it up: [the team is 7-2 (one DNP, a win) when Melo plays less than 31 minutes, 4-8 when he takes 17+ shots, and 6-10 when he scores 16+ points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01/gamelog/2018).

The thing is, this play style also leads to some spectacular offensive rebounds and steals: Russ acts like an innocent sheep, then flies in from out of nowhere, showing himself to be a wolf. It\u2019s not exactly technically sound, but it can be very entertaining.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall, I think the Thunder will be fine. I don\u2019t see the teams currently in the 4-8 spots as being significantly better than OKC in any way. OKC has multiple weaknesses and plenty of things to work on, but it\u2019s a long season, and talent usually prevails in the end. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they made another trade to increase their depth: Raymond Felton and Jerami Grant have both been solid off the bench, but Patrick Patterson has been abysmal and Alex Abrines is barely hanging onto his rotation spot.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: OKC\u2019s had a rough start to the season, but I think they\u2019ll improve as the season goes on. Their 21st ranked offense has been buoyed by their 4th ranked defense. To clearly define their roles and increase efficiency, the coaching staff should consider running more two-man actions with Paul George and Steven Adams, and possibly move Carmelo Anthony to the bench for a better fit. Westbrook is still the same player, he just doesn\u2019t feel the same freedom to do whatever he wanted like last season. They\u2019ll be fine to make the playoffs, but will be in trouble once they get there if things don\u2019t get better. \n\n\nEdit: few typos\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "dquskia", "body": "Pretty sure Melo would rather go home than come off the bench. \nIt\u2019s hard to score efficiently when you have 3 iso players constantly having a dick measuring contest.

The team are 27th out of 30 in FG%, 3PT%, and FT%, respectively, all hallmarks of inefficiency. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony have been number one scoring options for much of their careers, so combining them with a historic Usage Rate player in Russell Westbrook has made for an awkward adjustment period during the first portion of their tenure together. The three currently average 53 of the team\u2019s 85.7 Field Goal Attempts per game, or 61.8%, one of the highest marks in the league. However, PG-13, Russ and Melo only average 61.7 of the team\u2019s 102 PTS, a 60.5% mark, meaning they are *below* the rest of the team\u2019s efficiency level. This is incredible for many reasons, especially considering the general perception of the team as being extremely top heavy. \n\n\nThe threesome\u2019s unfamiliarity and lack of synergy has been evident: too many possessions begin and end with one of the players taking a contested mid to long range jumper with zero passes.

There\u2019s no sugar coating it, from an offensive standpoint, it\u2019s been ugly thus far. PG-13, Russ and Melo must share the ball more for the offense to operate as something resembling a contending unit. It\u2019s perplexing that so much collective talent has led to such mediocre results. \n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still early in the season. Despite their offensive struggles, there are signs that OKC are not as mediocre as their record would indicate. The team\u2019s expected (Pythagorean) Win-Loss based on Points For and Against is a reasonable [14-9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2018.html). The Thunder are 3-9 in games decided by 8 points or less (all three wins coming during their current winning streak), a mark sure to reverse and normalize over time. They possess the 4th ranked defense in the league, led by standouts George and Andre Roberson, two of the best wing defenders in the business. There are reasons to be concerned, but it\u2019s likely the Thunder will improve over time. It would be the biggest shock of the season if they did not make the playoffs, but that is largely immaterial. What really matters is their seeding: if they are one of the bottom three seeds in the Western Conference playoffs, OKC will likely have to play one of GSW, HOU or SAS in the first round, meaning they will have to go through at minimum two of those teams to make the NBA Finals, a near impossible task \u2013 one they nearly pulled off in 2016 (albeit with a much different roster; only the core of Westbrook/Roberson/Adams remain of the regulars).\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nA Few Key Points and then Possible Solutions\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Paul George](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html) is the most efficient scorer of the \u201cbig three.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge is 27, just entering his \u201cprime\u201d (typically thought to be between ages 27-32). [Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html) is 29. [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) is 33. Head to head comparisons this season (FG%/3PT%/FT%):\n\n\nPG-13: 42/41/82 (54 True, 56 Career)\n\nRuss: 40/32/72 (50 True, 53 Career)\n\nMelo: 42/35/81 (52 True, 54 Career)\n\n\nClearly, none have been stellar, aside from George\u2019s 3PT%. It\u2019s also worth noting that Carmelo has more than **10 times** as many shots as assists for the season (354 to 35). A legitimate case can be made that Paul George is the most complete and valuable player of the three: he\u2019s the best shooter, the youngest, and an incomparably superior defender. Westbrook doesn\u2019t try on D most of the time, he just gambles for steals (OKC is 2nd in the NBA in steals) and crashes the boards (something he does exceptionally well, but still). That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s incapable of guarding, he just doesn\u2019t try. Carmelo never used to either, but he\u2019s giving more effort now. The problem is, he\u2019s older and not good at it. \n\n\nFurther, OKC is 4-0 when PG-13 scores 28+ points. When Westbrook or Anthony score 28+? A combined 4-4. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Paul George is a Free Agent at the end of the season.\n\n\nIf the Thunder want to keep the Westbrook and PG-13 duo together long-term, it would be wise to keep George happy. It\u2019s no secret that he has a preference for the Los Angeles Lakers, and though they already have multiple 6\u20199\u201d+ forwards, George is versatile enough to play SG and would immediately become the best player on the team. However, after adding Anthony, PG-13 seemed to backtrack and throw his (notoriously tepid) support behind OKC. Westbrook [signed his supermax extension, per Woj](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/913845317115744257), at the end of September, so they no longer have to worry about him short-term. They\u2019ve already made him the \u201cman.\u201d Melo is far less crucial to the Thunder\u2019s long-term success, as both his [statistical profile](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) and age suggest that he has been in a slow, steady decline the past handful of years (FG% has dropped each of the past five seasons; he has an early termination option for a hair under $28 million next season, so he's unlikely to bail).\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* The team wins more when Westbrook shoots less.\n\n\n[OKC is 7-2 in games that Westbrook takes less than 19 shots. When he takes 19 or more? 4-10.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2018) He currently leads the team with an average of 19.6 shots per game.\n\n\nThis is not just true for this season, but in years past as well. OKC had far more team success when Westbrook was the #2 option behind Kevin Durant. Westbrook\u2019s usage rate skyrocketed when Durant was injured three years ago and gone as a FA last season, but the team\u2019s record was decidedly worse both seasons. True, this is partially due to the enormous skill disparity between KD and his replacements, but the Thunder simply play better when Westbrook operates more as a facilitator and less of a Kobe impersonator.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Steven Adams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html) is having a career year - he needs to, because he\u2019s getting paid $100 million (pre- taxes) over the next four seasons. \n\n\nAdams is a very good player who has shown marked improvement from his days as a raw, brutish rookie. He has consistently and continuously upgraded his game each off-season, adding new wrinkles to his repertoire, and this has been no different. Steven\u2019s scoring a career high 13.5 PPG on career highs in efficiency across the board (65 FG%, 69 FT%, 67% True). He possesses a unique mixture of strength, size, toughness, agility, athleticism and soft touch for a true Center. He\u2019s an above average defensive player with both quick feet and hands. While not considered an elite 5, he is competitive with anyone in the league on a nightly basis.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* More two-man actions designed for Paul George and Steven Adams.\n\n\nThe two have shown good synergy in recent games, with George driving and finding Adams for bounce passes and lobs. Adams has excellent hands, regularly catching tough passes, and can finish with both. He has a knack for finding the soft spot in the defense and knocking people out of the way to hunt the ball when the opportunity arises. George possesses top notch ball handling skills for his size, although his decision making and timing can be questionable (not waiting for the big man to be set on Pick and Rolls, for example). Billy Donovan has run some of Kevin Durant\u2019s old sets (double high screens, pin down back-screens) for George and he\u2019s more than capable of executing them, especially with an enhanced role and comfort level.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Get Andre Roberson more involved\n\n\nYes, Roberson is a terrible foul shooter. Yes, his shot is quite ugly. Both of those things are true, but he\u2019s also a tremendous athlete with long arms and good leaping ability. Even if you just run backdoor screens and have him cut more for lobs he becomes more of a threat, as opposed to teams ignoring him entirely and OKC playing 4v5 on offense. Donovan, his staff, and the team need to get creative to find him more looks so opposing teams actually respect his ability to score a bucket.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Limit Anthony\u2019s minutes and possibly use him as a sixth man.\n\n\nDonovan started to go in this direction vs. Minnesota and San Antonio before increasing his minutes vs. Utah last night.

The team are 27th out of 30 in FG%, 3PT%, and FT%, respectively, all hallmarks of inefficiency. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony have been number one scoring options for much of their careers, so combining them with a historic Usage Rate player in Russell Westbrook has made for an awkward adjustment period during the first portion of their tenure together. The three currently average 53 of the team\u2019s 85.7 Field Goal Attempts per game, or 61.8%, one of the highest marks in the league. However, PG-13, Russ and Melo only average 61.7 of the team\u2019s 102 PTS, a 60.5% mark, meaning they are *below* the rest of the team\u2019s efficiency level. This is incredible for many reasons, especially considering the general perception of the team as being extremely top heavy. \n\n\nThe threesome\u2019s unfamiliarity and lack of synergy has been evident: too many possessions begin and end with one of the players taking a contested mid to long range jumper with zero passes. OKC are currently 25th in the NBA in Assists, nearly 10 less per game than #1 Golden State. The ball simply stops. There\u2019s no sugar coating it, from an offensive standpoint, it\u2019s been ugly thus far. PG-13, Russ and Melo must share the ball more for the offense to operate as something resembling a contending unit. It\u2019s perplexing that so much collective talent has led to such mediocre results. \n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still early in the season. Despite their offensive struggles, there are signs that OKC are not as mediocre as their record would indicate. The team\u2019s expected (Pythagorean) Win-Loss based on Points For and Against is a reasonable [14-9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2018.html). The Thunder are 3-9 in games decided by 8 points or less (all three wins coming during their current winning streak), a mark sure to reverse and normalize over time. They possess the 4th ranked defense in the league, led by standouts George and Andre Roberson, two of the best wing defenders in the business. There are reasons to be concerned, but it\u2019s likely the Thunder will improve over time. It would be the biggest shock of the season if they did not make the playoffs, but that is largely immaterial. What really matters is their seeding: if they are one of the bottom three seeds in the Western Conference playoffs, OKC will likely have to play one of GSW, HOU or SAS in the first round, meaning they will have to go through at minimum two of those teams to make the NBA Finals, a near impossible task \u2013 one they nearly pulled off in 2016 (albeit with a much different roster; only the core of Westbrook/Roberson/Adams remain of the regulars).\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nA Few Key Points and then Possible Solutions\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Paul George](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html) is the most efficient scorer of the \u201cbig three.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge is 27, just entering his \u201cprime\u201d (typically thought to be between ages 27-32). [Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html) is 29. [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) is 33. Head to head comparisons this season (FG%/3PT%/FT%):\n\n\nPG-13: 42/41/82 (54 True, 56 Career)\n\nRuss: 40/32/72 (50 True, 53 Career)\n\nMelo: 42/35/81 (52 True, 54 Career)\n\n\nClearly, none have been stellar, aside from George\u2019s 3PT%. It\u2019s also worth noting that Carmelo has more than **10 times** as many shots as assists for the season (354 to 35). A legitimate case can be made that Paul George is the most complete and valuable player of the three: he\u2019s the best shooter, the youngest, and an incomparably superior defender. Westbrook doesn\u2019t try on D most of the time, he just gambles for steals (OKC is 2nd in the NBA in steals) and crashes the boards (something he does exceptionally well, but still). That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s incapable of guarding, he just doesn\u2019t try. Carmelo never used to either, but he\u2019s giving more effort now. The problem is, he\u2019s older and not good at it. \n\n\nFurther, OKC is 4-0 when PG-13 scores 28+ points. When Westbrook or Anthony score 28+? A combined 4-4. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Paul George is a Free Agent at the end of the season.\n\n\nIf the Thunder want to keep the Westbrook and PG-13 duo together long-term, it would be wise to keep George happy. It\u2019s no secret that he has a preference for the Los Angeles Lakers, and though they already have multiple 6\u20199\u201d+ forwards, George is versatile enough to play SG and would immediately become the best player on the team. However, after adding Anthony, PG-13 seemed to backtrack and throw his (notoriously tepid) support behind OKC. Westbrook [signed his supermax extension, per Woj](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/913845317115744257), at the end of September, so they no longer have to worry about him short-term. They\u2019ve already made him the \u201cman.\u201d Melo is far less crucial to the Thunder\u2019s long-term success, as both his [statistical profile](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) and age suggest that he has been in a slow, steady decline the past handful of years (FG% has dropped each of the past five seasons; he has an early termination option for a hair under $28 million next season, so he's unlikely to bail).\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* The team wins more when Westbrook shoots less.\n\n\n[OKC is 7-2 in games that Westbrook takes less than 19 shots. When he takes 19 or more? 4-10.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2018) He currently leads the team with an average of 19.6 shots per game.\n\n\nThis is not just true for this season, but in years past as well. OKC had far more team success when Westbrook was the #2 option behind Kevin Durant. Westbrook\u2019s usage rate skyrocketed when Durant was injured three years ago and gone as a FA last season, but the team\u2019s record was decidedly worse both seasons. True, this is partially due to the enormous skill disparity between KD and his replacements, but the Thunder simply play better when Westbrook operates more as a facilitator and less of a Kobe impersonator.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Steven Adams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html) is having a career year - he needs to, because he\u2019s getting paid $100 million (pre- taxes) over the next four seasons. \n\n\nAdams is a very good player who has shown marked improvement from his days as a raw, brutish rookie. He has consistently and continuously upgraded his game each off-season, adding new wrinkles to his repertoire, and this has been no different. Steven\u2019s scoring a career high 13.5 PPG on career highs in efficiency across the board (65 FG%, 69 FT%, 67% True). He possesses a unique mixture of strength, size, toughness, agility, athleticism and soft touch for a true Center. He\u2019s an above average defensive player with both quick feet and hands. While not considered an elite 5, he is competitive with anyone in the league on a nightly basis.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* More two-man actions designed for Paul George and Steven Adams.\n\n\nThe two have shown good synergy in recent games, with George driving and finding Adams for bounce passes and lobs. Adams has excellent hands, regularly catching tough passes, and can finish with both. He has a knack for finding the soft spot in the defense and knocking people out of the way to hunt the ball when the opportunity arises. George possesses top notch ball handling skills for his size, although his decision making and timing can be questionable (not waiting for the big man to be set on Pick and Rolls, for example). Billy Donovan has run some of Kevin Durant\u2019s old sets (double high screens, pin down back-screens) for George and he\u2019s more than capable of executing them, especially with an enhanced role and comfort level.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Get Andre Roberson more involved\n\n\nYes, Roberson is a terrible foul shooter. Yes, his shot is quite ugly. Both of those things are true, but he\u2019s also a tremendous athlete with long arms and good leaping ability. Even if you just run backdoor screens and have him cut more for lobs he becomes more of a threat, as opposed to teams ignoring him entirely and OKC playing 4v5 on offense. Donovan, his staff, and the team need to get creative to find him more looks so opposing teams actually respect his ability to score a bucket.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Limit Anthony\u2019s minutes and possibly use him as a sixth man.\n\n\nDonovan started to go in this direction vs. Minnesota and San Antonio before increasing his minutes vs. Utah last night. Melo scoffed at the notion of [coming off the bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t7nRSezCHo) prior to the season, and reiterated his dislike for the idea prior to their recent winning streak. I personally think both he and the team would play better with the change, much like Dwyane Wade\u2019s success leading the Cavs second unit. George, Westbrook and Anthony all need the ball, but they can\u2019t all have it playing together at the same time. The numbers back it up: [the team is 7-2 (one DNP, a win) when Melo plays less than 31 minutes, 4-8 when he takes 17+ shots, and 6-10 when he scores 16+ points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01/gamelog/2018). The numbers also say that he should be more aggressive in driving and posting, because the team is 5-2 when he has 5+ Free Throw Attempts.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Russ needs to be a more active participant when he doesn\u2019t have the ball\n\n\nToo many times Westbrook can be spotted camping five feet behind the three-point line readying himself for a high degree of difficulty shot instead of moving without the ball.

The team are 27th out of 30 in FG%, 3PT%, and FT%, respectively, all hallmarks of inefficiency. Paul George and Carmelo Anthony have been number one scoring options for much of their careers, so combining them with a historic Usage Rate player in Russell Westbrook has made for an awkward adjustment period during the first portion of their tenure together. The three currently average 53 of the team\u2019s 85.7 Field Goal Attempts per game, or 61.8%, one of the highest marks in the league. However, PG-13, Russ and Melo only average 61.7 of the team\u2019s 102 PTS, a 60.5% mark, meaning they are *below* the rest of the team\u2019s efficiency level. This is incredible for many reasons, especially considering the general perception of the team as being extremely top heavy. \n\n\nThe threesome\u2019s unfamiliarity and lack of synergy has been evident: too many possessions begin and end with one of the players taking a contested mid to long range jumper with zero passes. OKC are currently 25th in the NBA in Assists, nearly 10 less per game than #1 Golden State. The ball simply stops. There\u2019s no sugar coating it, from an offensive standpoint, it\u2019s been ugly thus far. PG-13, Russ and Melo must share the ball more for the offense to operate as something resembling a contending unit. It\u2019s perplexing that so much collective talent has led to such mediocre results. \n\n\nHowever, it\u2019s still early in the season. Despite their offensive struggles, there are signs that OKC are not as mediocre as their record would indicate. The team\u2019s expected (Pythagorean) Win-Loss based on Points For and Against is a reasonable [14-9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/OKC/2018.html). The Thunder are 3-9 in games decided by 8 points or less (all three wins coming during their current winning streak), a mark sure to reverse and normalize over time. They possess the 4th ranked defense in the league, led by standouts George and Andre Roberson, two of the best wing defenders in the business. There are reasons to be concerned, but it\u2019s likely the Thunder will improve over time. It would be the biggest shock of the season if they did not make the playoffs, but that is largely immaterial. What really matters is their seeding: if they are one of the bottom three seeds in the Western Conference playoffs, OKC will likely have to play one of GSW, HOU or SAS in the first round, meaning they will have to go through at minimum two of those teams to make the NBA Finals, a near impossible task \u2013 one they nearly pulled off in 2016 (albeit with a much different roster; only the core of Westbrook/Roberson/Adams remain of the regulars).\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nA Few Key Points and then Possible Solutions\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Paul George](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/georgpa01.html) is the most efficient scorer of the \u201cbig three.\u201d\n\n\nGeorge is 27, just entering his \u201cprime\u201d (typically thought to be between ages 27-32). [Russell Westbrook](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01.html) is 29. [Carmelo Anthony](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) is 33. Head to head comparisons this season (FG%/3PT%/FT%):\n\n\nPG-13: 42/41/82 (54 True, 56 Career)\n\nRuss: 40/32/72 (50 True, 53 Career)\n\nMelo: 42/35/81 (52 True, 54 Career)\n\n\nClearly, none have been stellar, aside from George\u2019s 3PT%. It\u2019s also worth noting that Carmelo has more than **10 times** as many shots as assists for the season (354 to 35). A legitimate case can be made that Paul George is the most complete and valuable player of the three: he\u2019s the best shooter, the youngest, and an incomparably superior defender. Westbrook doesn\u2019t try on D most of the time, he just gambles for steals (OKC is 2nd in the NBA in steals) and crashes the boards (something he does exceptionally well, but still). That\u2019s not to say he\u2019s incapable of guarding, he just doesn\u2019t try. Carmelo never used to either, but he\u2019s giving more effort now. The problem is, he\u2019s older and not good at it. \n\n\nFurther, OKC is 4-0 when PG-13 scores 28+ points. When Westbrook or Anthony score 28+? A combined 4-4. \n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Paul George is a Free Agent at the end of the season.\n\n\nIf the Thunder want to keep the Westbrook and PG-13 duo together long-term, it would be wise to keep George happy. It\u2019s no secret that he has a preference for the Los Angeles Lakers, and though they already have multiple 6\u20199\u201d+ forwards, George is versatile enough to play SG and would immediately become the best player on the team. However, after adding Anthony, PG-13 seemed to backtrack and throw his (notoriously tepid) support behind OKC. Westbrook [signed his supermax extension, per Woj](https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/913845317115744257), at the end of September, so they no longer have to worry about him short-term. They\u2019ve already made him the \u201cman.\u201d Melo is far less crucial to the Thunder\u2019s long-term success, as both his [statistical profile](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html) and age suggest that he has been in a slow, steady decline the past handful of years (FG% has dropped each of the past five seasons; he has an early termination option for a hair under $28 million next season, so he's unlikely to bail).\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* The team wins more when Westbrook shoots less.\n\n\n[OKC is 7-2 in games that Westbrook takes less than 19 shots. When he takes 19 or more? 4-10.](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/westbru01/gamelog/2018) He currently leads the team with an average of 19.6 shots per game.\n\n\nThis is not just true for this season, but in years past as well. OKC had far more team success when Westbrook was the #2 option behind Kevin Durant. Westbrook\u2019s usage rate skyrocketed when Durant was injured three years ago and gone as a FA last season, but the team\u2019s record was decidedly worse both seasons. True, this is partially due to the enormous skill disparity between KD and his replacements, but the Thunder simply play better when Westbrook operates more as a facilitator and less of a Kobe impersonator.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* [Steven Adams](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/adamsst01.html) is having a career year - he needs to, because he\u2019s getting paid $100 million (pre- taxes) over the next four seasons. \n\n\nAdams is a very good player who has shown marked improvement from his days as a raw, brutish rookie. He has consistently and continuously upgraded his game each off-season, adding new wrinkles to his repertoire, and this has been no different. Steven\u2019s scoring a career high 13.5 PPG on career highs in efficiency across the board (65 FG%, 69 FT%, 67% True). He possesses a unique mixture of strength, size, toughness, agility, athleticism and soft touch for a true Center. He\u2019s an above average defensive player with both quick feet and hands. While not considered an elite 5, he is competitive with anyone in the league on a nightly basis.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nPossible solutions:\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* More two-man actions designed for Paul George and Steven Adams.\n\n\nThe two have shown good synergy in recent games, with George driving and finding Adams for bounce passes and lobs. Adams has excellent hands, regularly catching tough passes, and can finish with both. He has a knack for finding the soft spot in the defense and knocking people out of the way to hunt the ball when the opportunity arises. George possesses top notch ball handling skills for his size, although his decision making and timing can be questionable (not waiting for the big man to be set on Pick and Rolls, for example). Billy Donovan has run some of Kevin Durant\u2019s old sets (double high screens, pin down back-screens) for George and he\u2019s more than capable of executing them, especially with an enhanced role and comfort level.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Get Andre Roberson more involved\n\n\nYes, Roberson is a terrible foul shooter. Yes, his shot is quite ugly. Both of those things are true, but he\u2019s also a tremendous athlete with long arms and good leaping ability. Even if you just run backdoor screens and have him cut more for lobs he becomes more of a threat, as opposed to teams ignoring him entirely and OKC playing 4v5 on offense. Donovan, his staff, and the team need to get creative to find him more looks so opposing teams actually respect his ability to score a bucket.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Limit Anthony\u2019s minutes and possibly use him as a sixth man.\n\n\nDonovan started to go in this direction vs. Minnesota and San Antonio before increasing his minutes vs. Utah last night. Melo scoffed at the notion of [coming off the bench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t7nRSezCHo) prior to the season, and reiterated his dislike for the idea prior to their recent winning streak. I personally think both he and the team would play better with the change, much like Dwyane Wade\u2019s success leading the Cavs second unit. George, Westbrook and Anthony all need the ball, but they can\u2019t all have it playing together at the same time. The numbers back it up: [the team is 7-2 (one DNP, a win) when Melo plays less than 31 minutes, 4-8 when he takes 17+ shots, and 6-10 when he scores 16+ points](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01/gamelog/2018). The numbers also say that he should be more aggressive in driving and posting, because the team is 5-2 when he has 5+ Free Throw Attempts.\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n* Russ needs to be a more active participant when he doesn\u2019t have the ball\n\n\nToo many times Westbrook can be spotted camping five feet behind the three-point line readying himself for a high degree of difficulty shot instead of moving without the ball. When the rest of the team sees their leader doing this, they\u2019re less likely to move around (like they should be) too. You can only pin so much blame on coaching when a player refuses to change. The thing is, this play style also leads to some spectacular offensive rebounds and steals: Russ acts like an innocent sheep, then flies in from out of nowhere, showing himself to be a wolf. It\u2019s not exactly technically sound, but it can be very entertaining.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall, I think the Thunder will be fine. I don\u2019t see the teams currently in the 4-8 spots as being significantly better than OKC in any way. OKC has multiple weaknesses and plenty of things to work on, but it\u2019s a long season, and talent usually prevails in the end. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they made another trade to increase their depth: Raymond Felton and Jerami Grant have both been solid off the bench, but Patrick Patterson has been abysmal and Alex Abrines is barely hanging onto his rotation spot.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: OKC\u2019s had a rough start to the season, but I think they\u2019ll improve as the season goes on. Their 21st ranked offense has been buoyed by their 4th ranked defense. To clearly define their roles and increase efficiency, the coaching staff should consider running more two-man actions with Paul George and Steven Adams, and possibly move Carmelo Anthony to the bench for a better fit. Westbrook is still the same player, he just doesn\u2019t feel the same freedom to do whatever he wanted like last season. They\u2019ll be fine to make the playoffs, but will be in trouble once they get there if things don\u2019t get better. \n\n\nEdit: few typos\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"id": "dqv5ih5", "body": "Im pretty sure OKC is last in passes per game and first in iso plays per game.
