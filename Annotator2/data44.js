They've also won 5 of their last 7 games so I think they might have more than a shot at the 8th seed. Also, they traded 4 players for 2 players, so it's not like they gutted their roster.\n\nI can empathize with you being a small market team, I'm sure that it gets tough but one of the main reasons Indiana was not in the same situation that OKC and Minny were in, is because they never had the opportunity to full out tank. Because Danny Granger was very much the star when Paul George arrived, they have been a consistently good team for many years. It prevented them from gaining assets however which left them with minimal room to acquire talent elsewhere.\n\nNow PG tried to make it work with what he had and he came pretty damn close. If it weren't for the Heatles he might have a ring there and history would be different. He would be a lifer. But, that didn't happen and he decided to leave. Now it is my opinion but I feel that he at least did you all a favor by letting you know his intentions for next summer. I know it sucks and it hurts but he didn't leave you high and dry the way others have in the past. You were able to get a return and in some people's eyes you arguably won that trade.\n\nI've been a big fan of Indy for some time especially with Myles Turner who I believe has superstar talent. I believe paired with Vic and Sabonis and some of your other key young guys you have a very bright future in Indiana. We will always have the Larry Bird connection so I will always be rooting for you all to succeed.
