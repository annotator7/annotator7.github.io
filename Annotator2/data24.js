In my opinion it all started with Doc Rivers, who set the tone from the top. I think Doc came to LA with the idea that he's a proven championship level coach from his Celtics days and that brought some entitlement to him.

Wall has the size and strength factor over Tony, which i feel is the greatest difference. Both are very quick, and although prime Tony was quick in a shifty, crafty kind of way i think that John wall has more explosiveness and can power through defenders better. John wall is also a much better leaper, allowing for a greater ability to block shots. \n\nI personally feel like their balance, core, flexibility and coordination are about the same. I'm honestly just going off the eye test for these qualities though. I mainly look at the different ways TP and Wall finish near the rim.
