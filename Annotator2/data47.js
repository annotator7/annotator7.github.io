It was definitely a close race even beyond WB/Harden\n\nWell, offense is always more important and that's why he was ranked so high. Defense in the regular season is even less important because teams often don't go out of their way to exploit a matchup over the whole game. And since the MVP is a regular season award, offense &gt;&gt; defense.\n\nIn the playoffs I can see it play out differently. Just put whoever IT is guarding in a pick and roll and see what happens.

Also, Avery is a player I was so sad to see go, but defensively, I could see the arguments for him and smart.
