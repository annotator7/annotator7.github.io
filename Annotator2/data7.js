I have never enjoyed watching a player more than him. He's one of those players where stats don't tell the full story- even his first MVP season are misleading because he was \"only\" averaging 18 PPG, this man was an effortless scorer. The crazy thing about watching him was that he would seem like he was just effortlessly and aimlessly dribbling all over the floor, and then he'd [make a ridiculous pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUlUoIAUvHc) or [finish some circus shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5PT6Yb0aLs). He was like Messi, a floppy haired magician with the ball who made you say DDDJDD over and over again.
