I never considered this, because I've been getting streams from reddit/online, and usually there are no ads at all. Most of the time, during times that would have commercials, the streams either show Top 10 highlights or just the arena camera. \n\nThat being said, you didn't really say anything against the notion of the ads bringing in more money. Yes, their TV deal is mad huge. But the ad's probably contribute significantly too, right? Im not sure what the numbers are, but I would assume it only adds to the total sum. \n\nOverall, I think jersey ads are a net positive, rather than negative. Its just a form of advertising. If they start becoming \"The Morgan Chase Knicks\" then yeah I would be pretty pissed. I doubt that will happen, as I havent seen such a thing in Europe. I.e. Manchester U has Chevrolet as their main sponsor, with a big chevrolet logo in the middle, but they are still Manchester United, despite what their dress might look like.\n\n\nAlso, Boston Garden is still the Garden.
