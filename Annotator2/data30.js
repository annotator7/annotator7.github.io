I'm okay with my life to admit to the internet that I was posterized by a former DLeague player. I mean, this [dude cocked that joint back and banged on me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-yKw0Ceo1Q). I was helping on weak side, rotated over to cover the middle, and saw my life flash before my eyes...\n\nAnyway, I share that story in defense of all guys who have been dunked on. I woke up this morning to see the front page of /r/nba littered with [KD getting yammed on by Larry Nance Jr](https://streamable.com/xa6te) as well as [KD getting rimrocked by Julius Randle](https://streamable.com/qsipg). Bonus mention to some notable posters including [dunked on legend Brandon Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPN0ylFEaFo), [snubbed Larry Nance Jr. on now teammate Brook \"the real twin\" Lopez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pqfvWthszA), and [Blake Griffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwskDyzzvsM) on pretty much everyone during his entire career. \n\nI'm sure most coaches (including Steve Kerr) would tell you that KD was playing great defense on those possessions. Hell, we've had people writing articles about KD's Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) candidacy for over a year now, including, [NOT ESPN's Marc Stein](http://www.espn.com/blog/marc-stein/post/_/id/5042/kevin-durants-improvements-earn-defensive-player-of-the-year-shine-with-stein), [\"Don't talk to me about timeouts\" CWebb](https://clutchpoints.com/warriors-news-chris-webber-argues-kevin-durant-has-a-case-for-dpoy/), and a [Chris Haynes article](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/21359160/kevin-durant-gone-great-lengths-become-top-defender). \n\nTL;DR: KD got dunked on, yes it makes for good internet, but he's still a great defender making the right defensive plays."}, {"id": "drgzjbq", "body": "Nobody is clowning on KD for getting dunked on (beyond the fact that people will clown on KD for anything).
