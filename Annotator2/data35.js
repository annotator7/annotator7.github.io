I'm not going to knock you for disagreeing with me on it. I personally am no longer going to watch films I used to enjoy and no longer going to patronize or celebrate the flawed artists who made them. Same goes for \"artists\" in all fields, including athletics. That's a personal decision. But I fully believe it is always appropriate to bring up their darkness.\n\nThe only thing I would ask is that you evaluate it neutrally. Would you afford the same generosity to other people who have done evil things? Is it okay to praise Harvey Weinstein while avoiding all of the negatives of who he was because he helped promote so much beautiful in film? I think most would say no right now. But I recognize that Roman Polanski and Woody Allen continue to be praised and loved. I don't think they deserve to be praised anymore, I think the artist's sins ruin the art. Everybody needs to make that decision on their own.\n\nTo our knowledge, Kobe's thing was a one-time thing. I'm willing to give him more of a pass for that. But it shouldn't be forgotten and I think it should be okay for people to bring it up. It shouldn't define his career, but it should be acknowledged. It boggles my mind that so many people keep talking about how good he was to have two numbers retired without acknowledging why he wore two numbers. Denver and its fall-out caused him to create the \"Black Mamba\" identity and caused him to change his number. It's an important part of his career and failing to even acknowledge it is a disservice. I wish more people would at least ask the question, why did he change numbers?\n\n&gt;Drug users only destroy their own lives? News to me...\n\nYou described simple possession in your initial post. If you're talking full-out addiction and abuse, there's no chance in hell a player's legacy wouldn't constantly be affected by mentions of that aspect of his life. It's not often you hear about Darryl Strawberry, Lawrence Taylor, or Diego Maradona without at least a reference to their drug abuse issues. \n\n&gt;Sounds like you have a fulfilling career.
