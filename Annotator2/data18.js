[This article by Ben Falk does a good job of describing the scheme and its pros/cons.](https://cleaningtheglass.com/do-the-bucks-stop-here/)\n\nIn his first year as coach, Kidd led the Bucks to the 4th best DRTG in the league. In the following 3 seasons, the Bucks have ranked 24th, 21st and 25th in DRTG as the rest of the league got accustomed to the way they defend. \n\nThey've consistently been in the bottom 5 in both preventing shots at the rim and preventing 3s (although they've been a bit better at preventing 3s so far this season). Teams around the league are moving towards Moreyball and taking a larger proportion of their shots from behind the arc or at the rim. Jason Kidd's counter to this revolution is to emphasize a defensive scheme that maximizes the number of open 3s and shots at the rim that the opponent gets.\n\n**3. His scheme doesn't even fit his personnel**\n\nIt's not like Kidd has been dealt a bad hand and the Bucks roster is full of bad defenders who would be unable to succeed in any defensive scheme. They have personnel who would fit well in a switch-heavy defense.\n\n Over the last few years, the Celtics have made a point of acquiring players who have both length and mobility (Brown, Tatum, Hayward, Ojeleye, Marcus Morris, Horford etc) and they've switched their way to the #1 defensive rating this season. \n\nThe Bucks front office seems to have a similar idea as they've acquired players like Giannis, Middleton, Snell, Brogdon, Bledsoe, Maker who would in theory fit perfectly in a defensive scheme like the Celtics'.

Of late, however, he has been spouting absolute nonsense in his post game interviews.

You can look through Brogdon's game log to find more games like these.\n\nBrogdon is simply a much better player than any of those other guys listed and there's no reason for his minutes to be comparable to theirs in any game.\n\nYou're right about the Terry thing, I was going off memory and got my numbers a bit mixed up. I've edited the post to reflect that. The point still stands though, he barely played for the first 20 or so games of the season but once it was nearly December, he started getting significant minutes for a few games.\n"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7l0t02", "body": "Not really OC because everything in this post has been discussed ad nauseum on the subreddit.\n\n**1.

So Kidd just had to give some minutes to other guards. \n\n- Liggins is a pest on defence, that really helped us in some games (not always works); he also shooted surprisingly well (~45% from 3) till about a month ago. Then he almost stopped shooting after a couple of bad outings, which sucks. I guess the team hopes he'll start to shoot again rather sooner than later. With Terry not delivering and Delly being injured, he was our 4th best/most experienced guard, and it reflected in his minutes.\n\n- Terry was honestly very good for us last year, so Kidd tried to use him a bit again, but JET is off so far, very bad. He hasn't played much, so that's not a big deal. \n\n- Vaughn is that guy who has an occasional amazing shooting performance, but 9 times out of 10 looks like he doesn't belong to the league. This is his third year, and the progress is minimal. Naturally, we didn't pick his option, but occasionally put him on the floor when everybody has a poor shooting night. Once or twice it worked.\n\n- Sterling Brown is a 2nd round rookie. He delivers in limited minutes, which are going up. Maybe he should have played more, but teams of Bucks level (pretty certainly going to play-off, but not #1/#2 seeds) rarely give a lot of minutes to 2nd round rookies from the start, Brogdon was a one-off. He looks competent and he'll be fine.\n\n- Payton II. Yes, he was bad. But he was on a 2-way contract and it literally looked like they wanted to get out of this deal as soon as possible. The contract expired and he was cut. I'll give you that, i was not a fan of Kidd playing him. Somehow he was not always a pure negative though.\n\n2/3. First of all, our roster in 2015/2016 was really bad. Enough to say that Bayless was probably our most competent guard, and he missed 30 games. Or maybe it was Mayo, but he missed a half of the season.\n\nSecond, our defensive rating last year was really bad with Parker without Middleton and OK with Khris without Jabari. Jabari is an atrocious defender. That's sad, but that's how it is. \n\nThird, Brogdon's defensive abilities are hugely overrated. He is clever, he does as much as he can, but he is just not athletic enough. \n\nFourth, Kidd's scheme has been changing for the last month, and it worked pretty well before we lost Snell for a few games, when it turned out that other guards (Bledsoe aside) were much worse defenders, which was not really surprising. Tony saved us yesterday with a couple of cluth rebounds, BTW. \n\nFifth, speaking about rebounds. Henson can block some shots, but he is not a good rebounder. Maker is a complete garbage this season, pure negative on both sides of the floor. And we either have to play him, or give up on yet another 1st rounder and play Giannis as a center for 20 minutes per game, which is probably going to kill him. There is yet another guy who can play center, Bolomboy on a 2-way contract, he looked like a rotation guy for limited minutes, but nothing more so far. This is how he's used.

Here are a few quotes of his just from the past month that I detailed in a comment earlier today:\n\n* (on why Jason Terry played 22 minutes in a game when he had played a total of 36 minutes in the first 18 games of the season) *edited*\n\n&gt;I\u2019ve always been a believer that your vets start to play in December. So it\u2019s December for us and he\u2019s going to start playing from here on out.\n\n* (on why he asked Khris Middleton to intentionally miss a FT with the Bucks up by 3 with 2 seconds left and the Cavs had no timeouts)\n\n&gt;We'll take the bet of someone missing it from the other side of the floor. being a gambler... understanding if we did make the free throw..our luck...they get it inbounds to half court and we foul the 3 point shooter and it's a 4 point play. So we'll take our chances with them heaving a full court shot.\n\n* (when asked how starting Gary Payton Jr. and the lack of floor spacing he brings might affect the team's success)\n\n\n&gt;Again, you can't lose the game in the first three or four minutes.\n\n* (on why he was intentionally fouling 86% career FT shooter Reggie Jackson with the Bucks up by 4 and 10 seconds left)\n\n&gt;They\u2019re trying to play the game of quick twos to save their timeouts, so we\u2019ll just play the free-throw game with them. I believe that my guys will make the free throws. They miss one and it works. It\u2019s a free-throw game no matter what, but we wanted to send them to the line\n\n---\n\nNow that Earl Watson has been fired and the perception of Hoiberg and Hornacek has improved now that they've been given teams better suited to them, Kidd has to be the clear choice for worst coach in the league.\n\n\n**Only excuse for not firing Kidd yet - Player Development**\n\nThe Bucks' have had a number of players exceed expectations including Giannis (15th pick), Middleton (throw-in in the Brandon Jennings/Brandon Knight trade), Brogdon (36th pick), Snell (acquired for MCW who will probably be out of the league next year). While the front office and player development coaches deserve some credit for identifying, acquiring and developing those players, it would be unfair to not give a major portion of that credit to Kidd. \n\nHowever, now Giannis is a bonafide superstar and Bledsoe and Middleton are in their primes, the Bucks should do what the Warriors did in 2014 and find a coach who would do a better job of maximizing their potential before it's too late. In a decision they might come to regret, the Bucks convinced Giannis to take a 4-year extension last year instead of making him their designated player and giving him a 5 year deal. It's unlikely they'll have the cap space to be major players in free agency during Giannis's current contract which makes the coaching spot one of the few ways they can upgrade in the near term.\n"}, {"id": "drj5aca", "body": "I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this.

I just don't think a lot of people who hate LaVar/want to see him fail realize why or who in essence they're rooting for in doing so.\n\nThe entire idea of the \"American dream\" is endless opportunity, and that idea has virtually been destroyed by corporations. There's still opportunity, but it ends where the corporations and billionaires tell you it ends. It might seem out of touch to use a well-off family like the Balls as an example of revolting from that, but it's true. Lonzo could've signed with Nike and they would've made a dollar for every dime they give him. Sure, it'd still make him wealthy, but they'd be poor compared to Nike. Instead, they're taking their chance and doing it their way, which is awesome to me.. Think about it like working a 9-5 job. You take it out of college because it's safe and you'll make decent money, and you never really stop to think about how much money your higher-ups are making off you. You consider yourself fortunate because you have enough and because the current hierarchy of society has been engrained into the fabric of our culture. Sure, the Balls are probably well-off enough that's it's not the biggest risk in the world, but the principle is still the same.
