Sadly, Jay Triano is doomed. Not only is he an interim head coach, he coaches for Phoenix, who fires coaches faster than the Orlando Magic do.\n\n*Prediction: fired immedietely after the season*\n\n**2: Jason Kidd (MIL)**\n\nIt really pisses me off that i finished writing this and almost forgot Jason Kidd. Really, it does. Because a coach as bad as Kidd right now deserves recognition for being a terrible coach. Kidd has managed to make a team with Giannis Antetokounmpo sputter out of control when they should be knocking heads around in the east. I could go on, but [/u/widesheep would tell you better than i can why Jason Kidd should be fired.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l0t02/reasons_why_jason_kidd_should_be_fired/)\n\n*Prediction: fired immedietely after this season*\n\n**3: Frank Vogel (ORL)**\n\nAfter a blazing hot start to the beginning of this season, i really thought the years of Orlando being a mediocre \"NBA hell\" team would be over. \n\nTurns out i was wrong and they are the exact Orlando Magic team that we've seen every year since Dwight Howard left. Never bad enough for a top 3 draft pick, never good enough for the playoffs. It truely is NBA hell. \n\nVogel is heiled as a defensive coach, but the Magic are 28th in points allowed this season and only 16th in offensive rating. You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep. Reddit's own Kevin O'Connor claimed that [Thibs needed \"an intervention\" in terms of redesigning how he distributes minutes and how he manages rotations.](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinoconnornba/status/938918459920080896)\n\nDespite all of this, the Wolves are winning. The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvlb2c", "body": "its funny how bulls, raptors, and paceres fans wanted their coach fired a year ago, and now theyre not on this list"}, {"id": "drvlb2c", "body": "its funny how bulls, raptors, and paceres fans wanted their coach fired a year ago, and now theyre not on this list"}, {"id": "drvldxm", "body": "McMillan has definitely shocked me.

Both are traded away."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mnm0s", "body": "\nAs we're about a third of the way into the season, some teams simply haven't been producing the output that is wanted by their respective FO's. Some coaches are underperforming, while others are mismanaging lineups and could be winning more games. These coaches are on the hot seat, likely (or more likely than the others) to be fired after the season.\n\n**1: Jay Triano (Interim) (PHX)**\n\nIt's almost unfair to put Jay Triano on this list because he's an interim coach, but if we're going by the rules of the hot seat, it's almost guarenteed he'll be canned when the season ends. I don't know a whole lot about him, besides the fact that he's Brady Heslip's uncle and also [drew up the game winning Tyson Chandler inbounds play to win the game for the Suns](https://youtu.be/dUUbWD22jAs). Sadly, Jay Triano is doomed. Not only is he an interim head coach, he coaches for Phoenix, who fires coaches faster than the Orlando Magic do.\n\n*Prediction: fired immedietely after the season*\n\n**2: Jason Kidd (MIL)**\n\nIt really pisses me off that i finished writing this and almost forgot Jason Kidd. Really, it does. Because a coach as bad as Kidd right now deserves recognition for being a terrible coach. Kidd has managed to make a team with Giannis Antetokounmpo sputter out of control when they should be knocking heads around in the east. I could go on, but [/u/widesheep would tell you better than i can why Jason Kidd should be fired.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l0t02/reasons_why_jason_kidd_should_be_fired/)\n\n*Prediction: fired immedietely after this season*\n\n**3: Frank Vogel (ORL)**\n\nAfter a blazing hot start to the beginning of this season, i really thought the years of Orlando being a mediocre \"NBA hell\" team would be over. \n\nTurns out i was wrong and they are the exact Orlando Magic team that we've seen every year since Dwight Howard left. Never bad enough for a top 3 draft pick, never good enough for the playoffs. It truely is NBA hell. \n\nVogel is heiled as a defensive coach, but the Magic are 28th in points allowed this season and only 16th in offensive rating. You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep. Reddit's own Kevin O'Connor claimed that [Thibs needed \"an intervention\" in terms of redesigning how he distributes minutes and how he manages rotations.](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinoconnornba/status/938918459920080896)\n\nDespite all of this, the Wolves are winning. The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvpa25", "body": "aah this is too long I'm not gonna read it \n\n&gt;  i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\nugh ok fine.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvpa25", "body": "aah this is too long I'm not gonna read it \n\n&gt;  i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\nugh ok fine.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvpf5e", "body": "Honestly, if OP really wrote this whole thing on his phone I'm seriously impressed."}, {"id": "drvpf5e", "body": "Honestly, if OP really wrote this whole thing on his phone I'm seriously impressed."}, {"id": "drwky2v", "body": "that had to be a long ass trip lol"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7hzdbw", "body": ""}, {"id": "dquwnn3", "body": "LeBron is like an average redditor. \n\n\nGets all their basketball knowledge from 2k "}, {"id": "dquwnn3", "body": "LeBron is like an average redditor. \n\n\nGets all their basketball knowledge from 2k "}, {"id": "dquwvni", "body": "Hello average Redditor"}, {"id": "dquwvni", "body": "Hello average Redditor"}, {"id": "dqvbtja", "body": "&gt; average \n\n&gt; redditor\n\n&gt; Cavs flair\n\n&gt; [Pizzapuff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wbnQtuayiuc/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nHi Lebron"}, {"id": "dqvbtja", "body": "&gt; average \n\n&gt; redditor\n\n&gt; Cavs flair\n\n&gt; [Pizzapuff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wbnQtuayiuc/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nHi Lebron"}, {"id": "dqvd12b", "body": "He's even honouring his father with his flair!"}, {"id": "dqvd12b", "body": "He's even honouring his father with his flair!"}, {"id": "dqvjqu6", "body": "I just spat out my drink.\n\nEdit: and I wasn't even drinking anything."}, {"id": "dqvjqu6", "body": "I just spat out my drink.\n\nEdit: and I wasn't even drinking anything."}, {"id": "dqvlxoh", "body": "I think that's called spitting"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hzdbw", "body": ""}, {"id": "dquwxkd", "body": "I bet LeBron spams the hell out of the X button on defense"}, {"id": "dquwxkd", "body": "I bet LeBron spams the hell out of the X button on defense"}, {"id": "dquxosb", "body": "Xbox X or PS X?"}, {"id": "dquxosb", "body": "Xbox X or PS X?"}, {"id": "dquxyj5", "body": "Xbox.

I will outline the points:\n\n1. Julius Randle is good and the Lakers are not bringing him back. They're fucking with his minutes, he's unhappy, and they're likely going to try to off-load him for assets (probably a mid-first for more cheap labor). Randle is the main collateral damage of the two max plan and it's going to come back to haunt them. He's an excellent pick and roll defender, he can guard most bigs in the post (Embiid is just too big),  he can switch on most wings (He guarded Harden well for stretches) and he's developing into a reliable one-on-one scorer. He basically has to clean up his turnovers and learn to pass better on his reckless drives. But he's putting up 12.5 / 6.3 / 1.8 in only 22 minutes (which are sporadic and random) and he's shooting 55% from the field. As a fan, I will be sad to see him go, but look forward to watching him blossom elsewhere (Portland would be a great situation for him if they can work a deal).\n\n2. Even if they stretch Deng, they're probably going to have to dump Clarkson to sign two max players, with cap holds. I know people have their issues with Clarkson, but he's a great energy guy and scorer off the bench of a reasonable contract for two more seasons. If you watch Lakers games this year - you'll notice he's basically the only wing on the team capable of getting buckets in a slowed down, half-court game.\n\n3. The Lakers do not look like they're going to be good enough to attract the best free agents - certainly not LeBron. The Cavs are 24-11 despite key injuries. If IT comes back looking close to full health, LeBron can tell the team he'll exercise his player option if they trade the Brooklyn pick for another piece. His road to the finals will be easier the next 2-3 seasons in Cleveland than virtually any other situation he can place himself in. I don't think Houston is feasible, nor do I think Harden wants to take a backseat to LBJ. San Antonio is a dark-horse to land LeBron, but I'm not sure the allure will be strong enough or guarantee enough for LeBron to deal with the tarnishment of leaving The Land. Certainly, joining the Lakers even with Paul George, doesn't get the Lakers to the Warriors level and it still has them likely behind at least Houston and maybe San Antonio.\n\n4. The Thunder are 12-3 in December and just came off two big wins against the Rockets and Raptors. PG is finding his role, the team is gelling, Melo is going to exercise his player option, Westbrook is locked up, and Adams is just becoming more of a monster. I truly think the Thunder will continue to ascend and make the WCF. They match up with the Warriors well enough to give them a series and I can't see George leaving a taste of that for the unknown in LA. I know it's a foregone conclusion in many people's minds that he goes to LA, but I don't think the Lakers will be as good as he expected and I think the Thunder will be better than he expected. Also, he's young, so I don't think it's out of the question for him to take a 2+1 max and hit the market again after his tenth season (when the max is much higher since he can't qualify for DPVE now).\n\n5. So if the Lakers are without George and LeBron - who can they reasonably target? I don't think they can convince Cousins to come without someone next to him. Perhaps Jimmy Butler in summer of 2019, but every team in the league with cap space will go after Jimmy.  Overall, I agree with the plan to target two max guys, but it looks like the reality of the situation is those guys won't be there and the Lakers will sacrifice Randle and Clarkson to chase it. And frankly, Ball/Kuzma/Ingram is never going to develop into a contender unless there's at least another ALL-NBA player added to that mix.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvh9jf", "body": "because that's not the plan....the plan is to draft gelo ball next year then yung melo ball the year after that and start the BBBxLAL dynasty "}, {"id": "drvh9jf", "body": "because that's not the plan....the plan is to draft gelo ball next year then yung melo ball the year after that and start the BBBxLAL dynasty "}, {"id": "drvhtzf", "body": "Fuck it, might as well draft Lavar and have him play the 5"}, {"id": "drvhtzf", "body": "Fuck it, might as well draft Lavar and have him play the 5"}, {"id": "drvivyz", "body": "too big too strong"}, {"id": "drvivyz", "body": "too big too strong"}, {"id": "drvket0", "body": "Neva lost"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7moog1", "body": "It's well known that Magic and Pelinka's plan is to create the cap space for two max free agents this summer and have those two all-stars round out the Lakers' young core. \n\nIn the Lakers' perfect world this will look like Lonzo / Ingram / Paul George / LeBron / Nance with Kuzma as the sixth man, Josh Hart, and cheap veterans/buy-out guys likely rounding out the rotation.\n\nNearly half-way through the season, this plan and the steps leading up to it are looking to be leading towards disaster. I will outline the points:\n\n1. Julius Randle is good and the Lakers are not bringing him back. They're fucking with his minutes, he's unhappy, and they're likely going to try to off-load him for assets (probably a mid-first for more cheap labor). Randle is the main collateral damage of the two max plan and it's going to come back to haunt them. He's an excellent pick and roll defender, he can guard most bigs in the post (Embiid is just too big),  he can switch on most wings (He guarded Harden well for stretches) and he's developing into a reliable one-on-one scorer. He basically has to clean up his turnovers and learn to pass better on his reckless drives. But he's putting up 12.5 / 6.3 / 1.8 in only 22 minutes (which are sporadic and random) and he's shooting 55% from the field. As a fan, I will be sad to see him go, but look forward to watching him blossom elsewhere (Portland would be a great situation for him if they can work a deal).\n\n2. Even if they stretch Deng, they're probably going to have to dump Clarkson to sign two max players, with cap holds. I know people have their issues with Clarkson, but he's a great energy guy and scorer off the bench of a reasonable contract for two more seasons. If you watch Lakers games this year - you'll notice he's basically the only wing on the team capable of getting buckets in a slowed down, half-court game.\n\n3. The Lakers do not look like they're going to be good enough to attract the best free agents - certainly not LeBron. The Cavs are 24-11 despite key injuries. If IT comes back looking close to full health, LeBron can tell the team he'll exercise his player option if they trade the Brooklyn pick for another piece. His road to the finals will be easier the next 2-3 seasons in Cleveland than virtually any other situation he can place himself in.

I will outline the points:\n\n1. Julius Randle is good and the Lakers are not bringing him back. They're fucking with his minutes, he's unhappy, and they're likely going to try to off-load him for assets (probably a mid-first for more cheap labor). Randle is the main collateral damage of the two max plan and it's going to come back to haunt them. He's an excellent pick and roll defender, he can guard most bigs in the post (Embiid is just too big),  he can switch on most wings (He guarded Harden well for stretches) and he's developing into a reliable one-on-one scorer. He basically has to clean up his turnovers and learn to pass better on his reckless drives. But he's putting up 12.5 / 6.3 / 1.8 in only 22 minutes (which are sporadic and random) and he's shooting 55% from the field. As a fan, I will be sad to see him go, but look forward to watching him blossom elsewhere (Portland would be a great situation for him if they can work a deal).\n\n2. Even if they stretch Deng, they're probably going to have to dump Clarkson to sign two max players, with cap holds. I know people have their issues with Clarkson, but he's a great energy guy and scorer off the bench of a reasonable contract for two more seasons. If you watch Lakers games this year - you'll notice he's basically the only wing on the team capable of getting buckets in a slowed down, half-court game.\n\n3. The Lakers do not look like they're going to be good enough to attract the best free agents - certainly not LeBron. The Cavs are 24-11 despite key injuries. If IT comes back looking close to full health, LeBron can tell the team he'll exercise his player option if they trade the Brooklyn pick for another piece. His road to the finals will be easier the next 2-3 seasons in Cleveland than virtually any other situation he can place himself in. I don't think Houston is feasible, nor do I think Harden wants to take a backseat to LBJ. San Antonio is a dark-horse to land LeBron, but I'm not sure the allure will be strong enough or guarantee enough for LeBron to deal with the tarnishment of leaving The Land. Certainly, joining the Lakers even with Paul George, doesn't get the Lakers to the Warriors level and it still has them likely behind at least Houston and maybe San Antonio.\n\n4. The Thunder are 12-3 in December and just came off two big wins against the Rockets and Raptors. PG is finding his role, the team is gelling, Melo is going to exercise his player option, Westbrook is locked up, and Adams is just becoming more of a monster. I truly think the Thunder will continue to ascend and make the WCF. They match up with the Warriors well enough to give them a series and I can't see George leaving a taste of that for the unknown in LA. I know it's a foregone conclusion in many people's minds that he goes to LA, but I don't think the Lakers will be as good as he expected and I think the Thunder will be better than he expected. Also, he's young, so I don't think it's out of the question for him to take a 2+1 max and hit the market again after his tenth season (when the max is much higher since he can't qualify for DPVE now).\n\n5. So if the Lakers are without George and LeBron - who can they reasonably target? I don't think they can convince Cousins to come without someone next to him. Perhaps Jimmy Butler in summer of 2019, but every team in the league with cap space will go after Jimmy.  Overall, I agree with the plan to target two max guys, but it looks like the reality of the situation is those guys won't be there and the Lakers will sacrifice Randle and Clarkson to chase it. And frankly, Ball/Kuzma/Ingram is never going to develop into a contender unless there's at least another ALL-NBA player added to that mix.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvi2cu", "body": "They should abandon the two max plan preserve cap-space down the road and keep the young pieces.  \n\nTrying to attract 2 max FAs when 2 of your main pieces are rookies and the 3rd is a 20 year old sophomore is just dumb.  \n\nThere are also good FA classes in the next 3 years.

The Lakers do not look like they're going to be good enough to attract the best free agents - certainly not LeBron. The Cavs are 24-11 despite key injuries. If IT comes back looking close to full health, LeBron can tell the team he'll exercise his player option if they trade the Brooklyn pick for another piece. His road to the finals will be easier the next 2-3 seasons in Cleveland than virtually any other situation he can place himself in. I don't think Houston is feasible, nor do I think Harden wants to take a backseat to LBJ. San Antonio is a dark-horse to land LeBron, but I'm not sure the allure will be strong enough or guarantee enough for LeBron to deal with the tarnishment of leaving The Land. Certainly, joining the Lakers even with Paul George, doesn't get the Lakers to the Warriors level and it still has them likely behind at least Houston and maybe San Antonio.\n\n4. The Thunder are 12-3 in December and just came off two big wins against the Rockets and Raptors. PG is finding his role, the team is gelling, Melo is going to exercise his player option, Westbrook is locked up, and Adams is just becoming more of a monster. I truly think the Thunder will continue to ascend and make the WCF. They match up with the Warriors well enough to give them a series and I can't see George leaving a taste of that for the unknown in LA. I know it's a foregone conclusion in many people's minds that he goes to LA, but I don't think the Lakers will be as good as he expected and I think the Thunder will be better than he expected. Also, he's young, so I don't think it's out of the question for him to take a 2+1 max and hit the market again after his tenth season (when the max is much higher since he can't qualify for DPVE now).\n\n5. So if the Lakers are without George and LeBron - who can they reasonably target? I don't think they can convince Cousins to come without someone next to him. Perhaps Jimmy Butler in summer of 2019, but every team in the league with cap space will go after Jimmy.  Overall, I agree with the plan to target two max guys, but it looks like the reality of the situation is those guys won't be there and the Lakers will sacrifice Randle and Clarkson to chase it. And frankly, Ball/Kuzma/Ingram is never going to develop into a contender unless there's at least another ALL-NBA player added to that mix.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvjeyj", "body": "Boogie this year, Klay Next"}, {"id": "drvjeyj", "body": "Boogie this year, Klay Next"}, {"id": "drvjybp", "body": "I am down with that plan."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7moog1", "body": "It's well known that Magic and Pelinka's plan is to create the cap space for two max free agents this summer and have those two all-stars round out the Lakers' young core. \n\nIn the Lakers' perfect world this will look like Lonzo / Ingram / Paul George / LeBron / Nance with Kuzma as the sixth man, Josh Hart, and cheap veterans/buy-out guys likely rounding out the rotation.\n\nNearly half-way through the season, this plan and the steps leading up to it are looking to be leading towards disaster.

Who are the bad 3. Why are they so bad. What changes can/did Billy Donovan make based on the data?\n\n2. Why does Alex Abrines stats look so good with Felton? Why is he in the dog house?\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he. Will he be important?\n\n4. How has Terrence Ferguson done? When should OKC play him?\n\n1. THE BAD 3\nOKC has the big 3. They also have the bad 3. I am only looking at lineups with Raymond Felton in this analysis. I also used 3-man Lineup ratings since they provide more data (minutes).\n\nHere's a table summarizing taking look at THE BAD 3!\nhttps://imgur.com/hqv6Geq\n\n\nRaymond Felton, Paul George, and Patrick Patterson have played 132 minutes together. They have a net rating of -30.5. If they played together for 100 possessions, they would be outscored at -30.5 points. Why is this happening?\n\nTwo indicators I find telling is DREB% and Pace. With Felton/George/Patterson in, OKC is only rebounding only 64% of the defensive rebounds. This is atrocious. This is clearly telling that Patrick Patterson is not a great rebounder for a center. Felton also is not like Westbrook who can just grab DREB. George's strength may also not be in defensive rebounding.\n\nThis same atrocious rebounding rates occur with Felton George and Grant. We know that these guys need to either work on their rebounding technique, or the coach needs to play Adams more. I'll get to this point in a bit.\n\nFelton, George, Grant and Felton, Grant, Patterson also have very low DREB %. It's just the same issues, and they have terrible net ratings to show for it.\n\nSwitching gears. NBA has changed to a fast pace game to generate more quality looks in transition. Felton/George/Patterson play super slow at 93. I was watching film, and Patterson really doesn't do anything on offense. He only gets shots up when he stands in the corner. His picks have not been helpful. He doesn't get the ball when he rolls or picks and pop. Maybe Felton in general likes to play at a slower pace. \n\nIf Felton likes to play at a slower pace, then having a great iso scorer MIGHT make sense to play with. Now this gets into the analysis of Carmelo Anthony. As you can see, Carmelo actually has played quality minutes with Felton.\n\nLook at the defensive rebounding numbers. Just replacing George iwth Melo really changes the rebounding numbers. This is important to note. There's no need to post these videos of Melo rebounding and saying \"get the F*** out\". Melo tries hard to rebound, just like Westbrook. Melo may not be the best P&amp;R or iso defender, but he can for sure rebound the ball.\n\nAlso, we can see the pace is relatively the same comparing George and Anthony. However, there seems to be better offense with Melo over George with the 2nd unit. Melo is the Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, of the NBA that can just score at will in the half court. From what I saw on film, George likes to run some plays and cuts, but Patterson really has not worked well with George as the screener.\n\nOK so basically you can tell that I am suggesting Billy play Melo more with the 2nd unit. Or somehow get more rebounding. This is where Steven Adams comes in. In the last game vs. Minnesota, Patterson barely played any minutes at center. He was mostly paired with Adams and it worked.\n\nhttps://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612760&amp;GroupQuantity=3&amp;CF=GROUP_NAME*E*felton&amp;Month=3\n\nYou can see here that Adams shows up in the top 5 for 3-man lineups with Felton. Billy saw that the rebounding was terrible, and he made sure Patterson only played the 4.\n\nTime will tell to see if this will work. Does Adams have enough energy to play center for long stretches with 2nd unit? Billy was letting Melo/Grant play 4 and 5 for stretches against Minnesota.\n\n\n2. Now it's time to show Abrines stats with Felton, ranked by minutes.\nhttps://imgur.com/vEFDAJx\n\nI am just confused why Abrines is not playing. I would say any net rating under -5 is great for a bench unit. They are able to hold their own. Unlike... Felton/George/Patterson of -30.5.  \n\nAnyways, there's plenty of minutes to see Abrines played quality ball. Their DREB is pretty good, above 70% for the most part, except for Felton/George/Abrines 3-man lineup. As you can see, Melo swap w George changes things.\n\nAlso pace is relatively higher with Abrines on the court. And true shooting % much higher in all Abrines lineups. He spaces the floor.\n\nI have watched all of OKC games. I am not quite sure why Abrines is in the dog house. Why is Ferguson coming in to play SG? Why not mix Felton and Anthony? George and the bench unit can't rebound well unless Adams plays more minutes with 2nd units. \n\nThe Alex Abrines situation is very complicated. Would love for r/NBA to show me evidence why Abrines is a terrible player and not good enough to play with 2nd unit.\n\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he?\nHe is a 6'7\" 230 pound small forward. His body shape looks alot like Roberson, except maybe a little thicker. He plays smart basketball, coming from Stanford.  He lets 3-balls fly with the 2nd unit, albeit at a 30% clip right now. But this is his first season to get major minutes. \n\nAnyways I noticed he has been making a relatively positive impact with the 2nd unit.\n\nHere's his 3-man lineup ratings with Felton:\nhttps://imgur.com/rSOimkA\n\nThey are all pretty good with a small sample size. One thing to focus on is the REB%. The DREB% is quite low at 62% with Patterson, however, REB% is at 43-44%. This is compared to Felton/George/Patterson of 36%.\n\nAgain sure, Adams can fix alot of the rebounding issues with second unit. But Huestis adds alot of offensive rebounding. He seems to play relatively smart.\n\n\n4. Terrence Ferguson has been a disaster to start the season.\n\nTake a look at this chart to see the net ratings...\nhttps://imgur.com/KfJvCWF\n\nI want to barf when I see this. Everything is above -30, except for Felton Melo Anthony. I clearly think there is something with Felton and Anthony. But anyways what's going on with Ferguson? The offense stinks so far when he plays. The defensive also is atrocius. PACE is way too slow in general with Ferguson in. True Shooting percentage is terrible.

They have a net rating of -30.5. If they played together for 100 possessions, they would be outscored at -30.5 points. Why is this happening?\n\nTwo indicators I find telling is DREB% and Pace. With Felton/George/Patterson in, OKC is only rebounding only 64% of the defensive rebounds. This is atrocious. This is clearly telling that Patrick Patterson is not a great rebounder for a center. Felton also is not like Westbrook who can just grab DREB. George's strength may also not be in defensive rebounding.\n\nThis same atrocious rebounding rates occur with Felton George and Grant. We know that these guys need to either work on their rebounding technique, or the coach needs to play Adams more. I'll get to this point in a bit.\n\nFelton, George, Grant and Felton, Grant, Patterson also have very low DREB %.

Billy saw that the rebounding was terrible, and he made sure Patterson only played the 4.\n\nTime will tell to see if this will work. Does Adams have enough energy to play center for long stretches with 2nd unit? Billy was letting Melo/Grant play 4 and 5 for stretches against Minnesota.\n\n\n2. Now it's time to show Abrines stats with Felton, ranked by minutes.\nhttps://imgur.com/vEFDAJx\n\nI am just confused why Abrines is not playing. I would say any net rating under -5 is great for a bench unit. They are able to hold their own. Unlike... Felton/George/Patterson of -30.5.  \n\nAnyways, there's plenty of minutes to see Abrines played quality ball. Their DREB is pretty good, above 70% for the most part, except for Felton/George/Abrines 3-man lineup. As you can see, Melo swap w George changes things.\n\nAlso pace is relatively higher with Abrines on the court. And true shooting % much higher in all Abrines lineups. He spaces the floor.\n\nI have watched all of OKC games. I am not quite sure why Abrines is in the dog house. Why is Ferguson coming in to play SG? Why not mix Felton and Anthony? George and the bench unit can't rebound well unless Adams plays more minutes with 2nd units. \n\nThe Alex Abrines situation is very complicated. Would love for r/NBA to show me evidence why Abrines is a terrible player and not good enough to play with 2nd unit.\n\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he?\nHe is a 6'7\" 230 pound small forward. His body shape looks alot like Roberson, except maybe a little thicker. He plays smart basketball, coming from Stanford.  He lets 3-balls fly with the 2nd unit, albeit at a 30% clip right now. But this is his first season to get major minutes. \n\nAnyways I noticed he has been making a relatively positive impact with the 2nd unit.\n\nHere's his 3-man lineup ratings with Felton:\nhttps://imgur.com/rSOimkA\n\nThey are all pretty good with a small sample size. One thing to focus on is the REB%. The DREB% is quite low at 62% with Patterson, however, REB% is at 43-44%. This is compared to Felton/George/Patterson of 36%.\n\nAgain sure, Adams can fix alot of the rebounding issues with second unit. But Huestis adds alot of offensive rebounding. He seems to play relatively smart.\n\n\n4. Terrence Ferguson has been a disaster to start the season.\n\nTake a look at this chart to see the net ratings...\nhttps://imgur.com/KfJvCWF\n\nI want to barf when I see this. Everything is above -30, except for Felton Melo Anthony. I clearly think there is something with Felton and Anthony. But anyways what's going on with Ferguson?

He spaces the floor.\n\nI have watched all of OKC games. I am not quite sure why Abrines is in the dog house. Why is Ferguson coming in to play SG? Why not mix Felton and Anthony? George and the bench unit can't rebound well unless Adams plays more minutes with 2nd units. \n\nThe Alex Abrines situation is very complicated. Would love for r/NBA to show me evidence why Abrines is a terrible player and not good enough to play with 2nd unit.\n\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he?\nHe is a 6'7\" 230 pound small forward. His body shape looks alot like Roberson, except maybe a little thicker. He plays smart basketball, coming from Stanford.  He lets 3-balls fly with the 2nd unit, albeit at a 30% clip right now. But this is his first season to get major minutes. \n\nAnyways I noticed he has been making a relatively positive impact with the 2nd unit.\n\nHere's his 3-man lineup ratings with Felton:\nhttps://imgur.com/rSOimkA\n\nThey are all pretty good with a small sample size. One thing to focus on is the REB%. The DREB% is quite low at 62% with Patterson, however, REB% is at 43-44%. This is compared to Felton/George/Patterson of 36%.\n\nAgain sure, Adams can fix alot of the rebounding issues with second unit. But Huestis adds alot of offensive rebounding. He seems to play relatively smart.\n\n\n4. Terrence Ferguson has been a disaster to start the season.\n\nTake a look at this chart to see the net ratings...\nhttps://imgur.com/KfJvCWF\n\nI want to barf when I see this. Everything is above -30, except for Felton Melo Anthony. I clearly think there is something with Felton and Anthony. But anyways what's going on with Ferguson? The offense stinks so far when he plays. The defensive also is atrocius. PACE is way too slow in general with Ferguson in. True Shooting percentage is terrible. Rebounding can be really bad depending on lineups.\n\nI get it. Ferguson is a Rookie. But is it really worth getting him more playing time in games where the outcome is in doubt? Let's not forget, OKC was favored 20/21 games already by Vegas. And we have this record.\n\nWould love to discuss my four points with anyone on r/NBA on a Saturday!\n\n\nTLDR\nGeorge w/ 2nd unit doesn't rebound and play slow. Adding Adams helps immensely. Melo w/ 2nd unit has worked quite well.\n\nAbrines disappeared. Not sure why. Very good performance so far... I think he must have a personal conflict.\n\nHuestis shows promise. Ferguson needs alot of work.

Who are the bad 3. Why are they so bad. What changes can/did Billy Donovan make based on the data?\n\n2. Why does Alex Abrines stats look so good with Felton? Why is he in the dog house?\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he. Will he be important?\n\n4. How has Terrence Ferguson done? When should OKC play him?\n\n1. THE BAD 3\nOKC has the big 3. They also have the bad 3. I am only looking at lineups with Raymond Felton in this analysis. I also used 3-man Lineup ratings since they provide more data (minutes).\n\nHere's a table summarizing taking look at THE BAD 3!\nhttps://imgur.com/hqv6Geq\n\n\nRaymond Felton, Paul George, and Patrick Patterson have played 132 minutes together. They have a net rating of -30.5. If they played together for 100 possessions, they would be outscored at -30.5 points. Why is this happening?\n\nTwo indicators I find telling is DREB% and Pace. With Felton/George/Patterson in, OKC is only rebounding only 64% of the defensive rebounds. This is atrocious. This is clearly telling that Patrick Patterson is not a great rebounder for a center. Felton also is not like Westbrook who can just grab DREB. George's strength may also not be in defensive rebounding.\n\nThis same atrocious rebounding rates occur with Felton George and Grant. We know that these guys need to either work on their rebounding technique, or the coach needs to play Adams more. I'll get to this point in a bit.\n\nFelton, George, Grant and Felton, Grant, Patterson also have very low DREB %. It's just the same issues, and they have terrible net ratings to show for it.\n\nSwitching gears. NBA has changed to a fast pace game to generate more quality looks in transition. Felton/George/Patterson play super slow at 93. I was watching film, and Patterson really doesn't do anything on offense. He only gets shots up when he stands in the corner. His picks have not been helpful. He doesn't get the ball when he rolls or picks and pop. Maybe Felton in general likes to play at a slower pace. \n\nIf Felton likes to play at a slower pace, then having a great iso scorer MIGHT make sense to play with. Now this gets into the analysis of Carmelo Anthony. As you can see, Carmelo actually has played quality minutes with Felton.\n\nLook at the defensive rebounding numbers. Just replacing George iwth Melo really changes the rebounding numbers. This is important to note. There's no need to post these videos of Melo rebounding and saying \"get the F*** out\". Melo tries hard to rebound, just like Westbrook. Melo may not be the best P&amp;R or iso defender, but he can for sure rebound the ball.\n\nAlso, we can see the pace is relatively the same comparing George and Anthony. However, there seems to be better offense with Melo over George with the 2nd unit. Melo is the Lou Williams, Jamal Crawford, of the NBA that can just score at will in the half court. From what I saw on film, George likes to run some plays and cuts, but Patterson really has not worked well with George as the screener.\n\nOK so basically you can tell that I am suggesting Billy play Melo more with the 2nd unit. Or somehow get more rebounding. This is where Steven Adams comes in. In the last game vs. Minnesota, Patterson barely played any minutes at center. He was mostly paired with Adams and it worked.\n\nhttps://stats.nba.com/lineups/advanced/?Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612760&amp;GroupQuantity=3&amp;CF=GROUP_NAME*E*felton&amp;Month=3\n\nYou can see here that Adams shows up in the top 5 for 3-man lineups with Felton. Billy saw that the rebounding was terrible, and he made sure Patterson only played the 4.\n\nTime will tell to see if this will work. Does Adams have enough energy to play center for long stretches with 2nd unit? Billy was letting Melo/Grant play 4 and 5 for stretches against Minnesota.\n\n\n2. Now it's time to show Abrines stats with Felton, ranked by minutes.\nhttps://imgur.com/vEFDAJx\n\nI am just confused why Abrines is not playing. I would say any net rating under -5 is great for a bench unit. They are able to hold their own. Unlike... Felton/George/Patterson of -30.5.  \n\nAnyways, there's plenty of minutes to see Abrines played quality ball. Their DREB is pretty good, above 70% for the most part, except for Felton/George/Abrines 3-man lineup. As you can see, Melo swap w George changes things.\n\nAlso pace is relatively higher with Abrines on the court. And true shooting % much higher in all Abrines lineups. He spaces the floor.\n\nI have watched all of OKC games. I am not quite sure why Abrines is in the dog house. Why is Ferguson coming in to play SG? Why not mix Felton and Anthony? George and the bench unit can't rebound well unless Adams plays more minutes with 2nd units. \n\nThe Alex Abrines situation is very complicated. Would love for r/NBA to show me evidence why Abrines is a terrible player and not good enough to play with 2nd unit.\n\n\n3. Josh Huestis. Who is he?\nHe is a 6'7\" 230 pound small forward. His body shape looks alot like Roberson, except maybe a little thicker. He plays smart basketball, coming from Stanford.  He lets 3-balls fly with the 2nd unit, albeit at a 30% clip right now. But this is his first season to get major minutes. \n\nAnyways I noticed he has been making a relatively positive impact with the 2nd unit.\n\nHere's his 3-man lineup ratings with Felton:\nhttps://imgur.com/rSOimkA\n\nThey are all pretty good with a small sample size. One thing to focus on is the REB%. The DREB% is quite low at 62% with Patterson, however, REB% is at 43-44%.
