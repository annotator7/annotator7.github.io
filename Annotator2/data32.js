The Cavs are fine, his team is fine and players get payed even when injured. \n\n&gt;  comparison look as Brandon Roy, couldn't play didn't wanna risk further injury and didn't want to complicate the blazers future plans so he stepped away from the game with grace and professionalism. \n\nSo you\u2019re angry at him because he\u2019s trying to do what\u2019s best for him and that goes against your subjective view of professionalism. I don\u2019t even know who Roy is and as I said above I don\u2019t see him messing up the Cavs future. \n\n&gt; Derrick rose had the world at his fingertips and had chance after chance after chance and im TIRED OF HEARING I SHOULD FEEL BAD FOR HIM. \n\nAnd he got injury after injury. If he retired after those injuries like you suggest he should he certainly wouldn\u2019t be close to the top of the world. And I doubt you\u2019d feel bad for him then either. He might not be close now, but there\u2019s still opportunity to be great at what he loves.

I tried to also include specific roles at various price points and skill levels (shooters, defenders, specialists).   The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together.  \n\n**For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqqf2f", "body": "Not to discourage you, but I find it highly unlikely you are going to get serious responses here."}, {"id": "dqqqf2f", "body": "Not to discourage you, but I find it highly unlikely you are going to get serious responses here."}, {"id": "dqqqfyg", "body": "Especially not at 3am lol"}, {"id": "dqqqfyg", "body": "Especially not at 3am lol"}, {"id": "dqqqie9", "body": "Yeah I always get kind of sad when I see good posts this late because I know they'll just get buried and forgotten.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqqh10", "body": "I love games like this!

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqsdba", "body": "Anfernee Hardaway 700\n\nCurry  1100\n\nMJ 1300\n\nWebber  800\n\nBoogie 700\n\n_____________\n\nIggy 600\n\nCJ McCollum 600\n\nRasheed 600\n\n______________\n\n\nBalance, Dfence, long, 3 ball, competitiveness..."}, {"id": "dqqsdba", "body": "Anfernee Hardaway 700\n\nCurry  1100\n\nMJ 1300\n\nWebber  800\n\nBoogie 700\n\n_____________\n\nIggy 600\n\nCJ McCollum 600\n\nRasheed 600\n\n______________\n\n\nBalance, Dfence, long, 3 ball, competitiveness..."}, {"id": "dqqsent", "body": "and athletic af"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hg73c", "body": "Hello Reddit and basketball enthusiasts!  \n\n*Disclaimer: This is a long post and will go through editing and improvements.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together.  \n\n**For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqquwkw", "body": "Learn to fucking write Nowitzki!

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqvfqs", "body": "So I think the key thing to exploit here is \"in their primes\", and justtske players who had like 1 amazing season for your team as a steal price.
