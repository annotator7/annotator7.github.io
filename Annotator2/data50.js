Did it restrict them from actually making good signings? No. Did they make good signings? No, outside of Sam Cassell. Did it restrict them from drafting well? No. Should KG feel bad about signing a max contract? No. Would Duncan have done the same? Probably. Was Minnesota's front office a colossal failure? Yes.  \n\nWhile KG and Duncan put up similar box score numbers, KG over his career has done considerably better in impact statistics and that's whether playing in Minnesota or Boston. In other words, the impact metrics suggest that KG had a bigger impact on winning than Duncan did.
