That is why the draft is weighted toward bad teams. However, despite the structure of the draft, only a handful of teams actually win championships. For example, during the entire lifespan of Knick's rookie Frank Ntilikina, only eight teams have won the NBA championship. Of those eight, two teams (Cavaliers and Mavericks) won their very first NBA finals after a combined 76 years of failure. The Celtics and Pistons also only won one championship in that interval (although they have historical championships - more on that later).\n\nMy point is that some teams have inherent, seemingly insurmountable advantages over other teams (mostly huge markets and deep checkbooks, or Popovich). Only *five* teams that are not in the 15 largest metro areas have EVER won a championship: the Spurs have five, and the Cavs, Bucks, Blazers, and Kings each have one.\n\nIf you're a team in a town like like Denver or Orlando or Charlotte or Salt Lake City, you're stuck in a small market with lower ticket prices, your franchise is less profitable, and you aren't a destination for the best free agents. History has shown that you have a 9/71 (12.7%) chance to win. If you're not the Spurs, you have a 4/71 (5.6%) chance of winning. If you were entering a competition where the previous winners had a 95% chance of beating you again because of demographics completely beyond your control, would you want to play?\n\nI'm arguing that there should be bonus points for teams that have never won a championship (poor Kings), or for teams that are very distant from their last championship (poor Hawks).\n\nHere's my hare-brained idea:\n\nIf you're a lottery team, you get as many ping-pong balls as your probability of success that year, based on your record (this is basically the current draft).

However, now we're going to add the *historical* ping-pong balls, and it changes things enough that the fractions don't matter. My idea is to give a team one ball for ever year that it has been since they won a championship, and take away one ball for every championship that they have won.

Teams like the Heat and Lakers (who share 8 recent championships) get lower odds of winning the #1 pick. And you know what? That's fine. It's LA and Miami, those are huge, vibrant cities with a lot of money and significant free-agent draw. They'll be fine. If they aren't fine and keep sucking, their lottery odds improve every year regardless of record that year. Can LA really be mad at the Kings for having the highest overall pick? No matter which way you slice it, there is no reason that a team should compete for *ninety four years* without a championship. That's utterly ridiculous. The league has failed the Kings. Get them even a single championship, and you will revitalize that beleaguered fan base and they will drop to the bottom of the lottery odds. Who wouldn't be at least partially happy if the Kings or the Suns or the Nuggets won a championship? Those teams try really hard and cannot catch a break, they shouldn't be victimized by the incessant draw of larger pocketbooks.\n\nThis will shake up the bottom of the league for a while.

History has shown that you have a 9/71 (12.7%) chance to win. If you're not the Spurs, you have a 4/71 (5.6%) chance of winning. If you were entering a competition where the previous winners had a 95% chance of beating you again because of demographics completely beyond your control, would you want to play?\n\nI'm arguing that there should be bonus points for teams that have never won a championship (poor Kings), or for teams that are very distant from their last championship (poor Hawks).\n\nHere's my hare-brained idea:\n\nIf you're a lottery team, you get as many ping-pong balls as your probability of success that year, based on your record (this is basically the current draft). For example, here is the last draft (I'm ignoring traded picks here like the Nets to the Celtics because we can't completely protect a team from themselves):\n\nTeam | # of balls\n---|---\nNets| 25\nSuns| 20\nLakers| 16\n76ers| 12\nMagic| 9\nTimberwolves| 5\nKnicks| 5\nKings| 3\nMavericks| 2\nPelicans| 1\nHornets| 1\nPistons| 1\nNuggets| 1\nHeat|1\n\nThis isn't perfect - you could keep the partial odds if you want (i.e. Mavericks actually have 1.7 balls). However, now we're going to add the *historical* ping-pong balls, and it changes things enough that the fractions don't matter. My idea is to give a team one ball for ever year that it has been since they won a championship, and take away one ball for every championship that they have won. Here's the new table:\n\nTeam | performance balls | loser balls | winner balls | total balls\n---|---|---|---|---\nNets| 25 |50|0|75\nSuns| 20|49|0|69\nLakers| 16|7|-19|4\n76ers| 12|34|-3|43\nMagic| 9|28|0|37\nTimberwolves| 5|28|0|33\nKnicks| 5|44|-2|47\nKings| 3|94|0|97\nMavericks| 2|6|-1|7\nPelicans| 1|15|0|16\nHornets| 1|27|0|28\nPistons| 1|13|-3|11\nNuggets| 1|50|0|51\nHeat|1|4|-3|2\n\nNow we re-order the draft to reflect the new odds, considering historical championships.\n\nTeam | Balls | New Lottery #1 Odds\n---|---|---\nKings| 97 |20.3%\nNets| 75 | 15.8%\nSuns| 69 | 14.5%\nNuggets| 51 | 10.7%\nKnicks|47|9.9%\n76ers| 43 |9.0%\nMagic| 37 |7.8%\nTimberwolves| 33 |6.9%\nHornets| 28 |5.9%\nPelicans| 16 |3.4%\nPistons| 11 |2.3%\nMavericks| 7 |1.5%\nLakers| 4 |0.8%\nHeat|2 |0.4%\n\nThis changes a lot of things for the better. Teams like the Heat and Lakers (who share 8 recent championships) get lower odds of winning the #1 pick. And you know what? That's fine. It's LA and Miami, those are huge, vibrant cities with a lot of money and significant free-agent draw. They'll be fine. If they aren't fine and keep sucking, their lottery odds improve every year regardless of record that year. Can LA really be mad at the Kings for having the highest overall pick? No matter which way you slice it, there is no reason that a team should compete for *ninety four years* without a championship. That's utterly ridiculous. The league has failed the Kings. Get them even a single championship, and you will revitalize that beleaguered fan base and they will drop to the bottom of the lottery odds. Who wouldn't be at least partially happy if the Kings or the Suns or the Nuggets won a championship? Those teams try really hard and cannot catch a break, they shouldn't be victimized by the incessant draw of larger pocketbooks.\n\nThis will shake up the bottom of the league for a while. There is much less incentive for a team like the Lakers to tank, because they can't beat the 94 years that the Kings have been losing. And they shouldn't - those Larry O'Brien trophies from Kobe's era aren't even dusty yet. It won't change the top of the league much right away, because those teams don't generally rely on high draft picks to win now. Things will change at the top once teams that keep getting high draft picks finally make good on those opportunities. The Lakers are still among the top destinations for free agents like LeBron and Paul George. If they hadn't tanked, they would probably have more win-now players to help fill out a roster/trade for superstars, anyway.\n\nSide note: there are three teams that *are* in a top-15 market and have never won a championship. Two of them (Clippers and Nets) share their market with a more popular and successful team (Lakers and Knicks). The third (Phoenix) has grown so fast that it has been a top-15 market for less than ten years. Regardless, these teams need to get their act together.\n\nTL;DR The best way to establish true parity and help small-market teams improve their odds of winning an NBA championship is to weight historical championships against those celebratory teams."}, {"id": "dryz9wb", "body": "If you want to eliminate tanking, just make the bottom team in each conference ineligible for the lottery (automatic #4 and #5 picks)\n\nTo the rest of it, you can't just guarantee the best pick to the historically worst team of all time every year.
