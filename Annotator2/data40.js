Efficiency is relatively the same (Probably favoring MJ more in terms of relative) and MJ clearly did it against better competitors. \n\n7 point difference in points is incredibly significant, especially considering the fact that MOST of the assists are very dependent on teammates. \n\nOffensively, MJ has a very very clear edge. \n\nDefensively, I can argue Lebron was pretty damn good in last year playoffs, but he always tend to drop off in the finals. He is not nearly the defensively player MJ was considering he is, at times, a mediocre defender in on-ball setting. If someone tells you Lebron is better than MJ defensively, I will be absolutely shocked. Lebron had six years of all defensive team, MJ has 9 FIRST team all defense. I won't even mention DPOY (Primarily because Lebron shouldn't have been CLOSE to getting second in DPOY and MJ, imo, didn't deserve it either). MJ is one of the best on ball defender I have ever seen, Lebron, isn't close to that level. While as MJ is very similar to Lebron's excellence in coming off the weak side. \n\nThe gap between Lebron and MJ in the finals literally cannot be compared. MJ destroys him.\n\nA better comparison in finals would be Kobe Bryant who averaged (Per 100 possession):\n\n**31.3/6.84/6/2.2/.9 with 52% TS (1.3% Above average)** \n\nKobe was clearly the better defender and clutch performer than Lebron in the finals, while Lebron posted better assists and rebounds.
