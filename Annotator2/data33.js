The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together.  \n\n**For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqwpuu", "body": "Dwight Howard for $1000?

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqqx9lx", "body": "Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and literally anyone else."}, {"id": "dqqx9lx", "body": "Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and literally anyone else."}, {"id": "dqqzaxk", "body": "Yea, so post it"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hg73c", "body": "Hello Reddit and basketball enthusiasts!  \n\n*Disclaimer: This is a long post and will go through editing and improvements.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

My other two utility guys exist to fill the holes in my roster. Johnson is an actually good defensive guard, which we desperately need.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqr12rn", "body": "PG: Chris Paul ($1000)\n\nSG: Klay Thompson ($700)\n\nSF: Larry Legend ($1200)\n\nPF: Kevin McHale ($1000)\n\nC: Demarcus Cousins ($700)\n\nUtil: Al Horford ($600)\n\nUtil: Andre Iguodala ($600)\n\nUtil: Mike Conley ($600) "}, {"id": "dqr12rn", "body": "PG: Chris Paul ($1000)\n\nSG: Klay Thompson ($700)\n\nSF: Larry Legend ($1200)\n\nPF: Kevin McHale ($1000)\n\nC: Demarcus Cousins ($700)\n\nUtil: Al Horford ($600)\n\nUtil: Andre Iguodala ($600)\n\nUtil: Mike Conley ($600) "}, {"id": "dqr16n5", "body": "Wanted to build an amazing defensive team with an offense that'd not be fun to combat too."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hg73c", "body": "Hello Reddit and basketball enthusiasts!  \n\n*Disclaimer: This is a long post and will go through editing and improvements.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqr2r7s", "body": "**PG:** Gary Payton ($1000)\n\n**SG:** Allen Iverson ($1000)\n\n**SF:** Ron Artest ($700)\n\n**PF:** Dennis Rodman ($900)\n\n**C:** Alonzo Mourning ($800)\n\n**UTIL:** Amare Stoudemire ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** Rasheed Wallace ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** DeMarcus Cousins ($700)\n\nFines add up to **$6400**"}, {"id": "dqr2r7s", "body": "**PG:** Gary Payton ($1000)\n\n**SG:** Allen Iverson ($1000)\n\n**SF:** Ron Artest ($700)\n\n**PF:** Dennis Rodman ($900)\n\n**C:** Alonzo Mourning ($800)\n\n**UTIL:** Amare Stoudemire ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** Rasheed Wallace ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** DeMarcus Cousins ($700)\n\nFines add up to **$6400**"}, {"id": "dqrjek5", "body": "This team will destroy you with that D.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqrhzq8", "body": "PG: Russell Westbrook - $1000\n\nSG: Reggie Miller - $900\n\nSF: Dominique Wilkins - $900\n\nPF: Shawn Kemp - $700\n\nC: Ben Wallace - $800\n\nUTIL: Damian Lillard - $700\n\nUTIL: Klay Thompson - $700\n\nUTIL: Marc Gasol - $700\n\n\nVery physical team, with scoring guards and strong big men.

I tried to also include specific roles at various price points and skill levels (shooters, defenders, specialists).   The best teams will likely have key utility players that help bring everything together.  \n\n**For your reference, here are the tiers as they currently stand.

The next best 10 players are all $1,200.   The best players from today's NBA are LeBron James ($1,200), Kobe Bryant ($1,200), Dwayne Wade ($1,100), Kevin Durant ($1,100) and Stephen Curry ($1,100).  There are defensive players, specialists and shooters at each price point.  Often times there are choices between a player of an older generation and a modern player of similar skill and position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Without further ado, here is the first team I built using these perimeters.**  First, I wanted to include Michael Jordan.   Doing so (at $1,300) instantly meant I had to cut elsewhere.   The only other sure pick I had in mind was Gary Payton ($1,000) to create the most dominant defensive back court of all time.  From there, I wanted to keep my defensive lock down identity while adding passing and play making.   This was the final product:\n\n**PG:** Gary Payton ($1,000)\n\n**SG:** Michael Jordan ($1,300)\n\n**SF:** Shawn Marion ($800)\n\n**PF:** Chris Webber ($800)\n\n**C:** Marc Gasol ($700)\n\n**UTIL:** JJ Redick ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Trevor Ariza ($600)\n\n**UTIL:** Joakim Noah ($600)\n\nAnalysis:  The \"Matrix\" Shawn Marion would fill the wing and run with MJ and GP.  He was also a defensive-minded wing that could run and jump with the best of them.   Chris Webber as the starting PF was incredibly talented.  He was a great passer, scorer, and could run the floor and handle the ball as well.   Marc Gasol rounds out the starting 5 as a defensive-minded center that played with finesse.  Gasol being able to stretch the floor and shoot 3's would help open up the paint and his abilities to both pass and block shots would shine on this team.\n\nOff the bench, JJ Redick would come in an sub for MJ or GP or used as a sharpshooter in smaller ball lineups or in key moments.   With so much attention to MJ and a lineup full of willing passers, a pure shooter is needed.  While there were better shooters at higher price points, JJ filled this role with the minimum cost.   Trevor Ariza would be the first wing off the bench, primarily backing up Marion and Webber.   Ariza was one of the best \"3 and D\" players and in his prime was an excellent defender as well.  He would help space the floor and continue with the team's identity.   Lastly, Joakim Noah would be the big off the bench to back up Chris Webber and Marc Gasol.  Joakim Noah was not great offensively, but he definitely continues with the defensive identity.  He could could defend and run pick and rolls very efficiently and could even handle the ball when needed.  His (lack of) offense would be fine here as there are plenty of other options.  Top to bottom, this team would lock you down and not be afraid to let you know about it.  MJ would lead the team in scoring while Chris Webber would usually be the second option.  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have found that the $6,400 number works well as you will find yourself shuffling players in and out to create your line up.   I like the idea of having to make difficult decisions.   This is still a rough idea and draft. I hope you enjoy thinking about it and building your theoretical dream team.  \n\n**Who's on your squad?**  "}, {"id": "dqrq5u3", "body": "Where's elgin baylor"}, {"id": "dqrq5u3", "body": "Where's elgin baylor"}, {"id": "dqrr87r", "body": "I didn't add some of the great classic players such as Elgin Baylor and John Havlicek.  \n\nI will consider adding them when additional players are added to the pool.

I wondered to myself whether this number would hold true for all team subreddits- like, is it more of an indication of reddit's increasing popularity, or does team success/branding play into it?\n\nI decided to repeat the exercise for the 29 remaining teams. \n\nWhile bearing in mind these numbers are just an annual snapshot every November (rather than monthly) I still think the numbers are pretty interesting, especially the growth of the Warriors subreddit from 2016 to 2017. I don't know if there is a way to map flair usage on r/NBA, but this kind of data might be the next best thing. If you feel like you've seen more Warriors flairs around in recent months, it might be because their subreddit is wicked huge. Like, staggering, look at that monster. On the other hand, what does it mean that the Heat have the smallest percentage of growth of all the teams? Or why do the poor Pelican diehards have to work doubles and overnights to keep the lights on in their sub? I dunno. Anyway, I'll leave it at that and let the numbers tell their own story.\n\nAlso, quick side note, I'm not a math guy, so if I've misspoken in calling some statistical ratio a percentage or something, my bad.  \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n**EDIT:** Folks in the comments have been pointing out that the Warriors sub has been infected by bot accounts, which would definitely skew the numbers. \n\n\n"}, {"id": "dqvih8f", "body": "I was one of the 1522 people that watched Sixers games when we couldn't beat Kentucky.
