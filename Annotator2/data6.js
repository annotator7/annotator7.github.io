The Wizards will exceed expectations in the first round of the playoffs again and fall short in the second round again.

This isn\u2019t to diss his passing ability. But LeBron has always been an elite, elite scorer. The fact that he\u2019s also an elite passer is what, combined with scoring (and his other qualities) makes him a surefire top 5 player of all time (not going to get into where exactly he ranks in there), but take away LeBron\u2019s elite passing and he\u2019s still a top 10 player of all time. Make LeBron an average scorer and he\u2019s nowhere near that (the same is true for probably any top 10 player of all time, unless you put Bill Russell [edit: and Magic] in your top 10)."}, {"id": "dqtl29x", "body": "I think we may have to agree to disagree on this, but I don't think scoring is what puts you into the all time greats.\n\nMagic and Russell are both in a lot of people's top 10's and neither were score-first players.\n\nAnyways, I do think, and am not the only one to think, that Lebron's passing and court vision (and more importantly, decision making) are his most dangerous assets offensively.\n\nObviously he's no scrub at scoring, he may very well end up with the most point in NBA history. However, I do think it is at the very least fair to say that scoring has never been his only objective. He has always wanted to impact that game in a variety of ways and has done that.\n\nThe fact that he scores, passes, and defends at an elite level and is now putting up elite outside shooting numbers is what makes this stat hella impressive (because he is right behind the single greatest shooting season ever)."}, {"id": "dqtl29x", "body": "I think we may have to agree to disagree on this, but I don't think scoring is what puts you into the all time greats.\n\nMagic and Russell are both in a lot of people's top 10's and neither were score-first players.\n\nAnyways, I do think, and am not the only one to think, that Lebron's passing and court vision (and more importantly, decision making) are his most dangerous assets offensively.\n\nObviously he's no scrub at scoring, he may very well end up with the most point in NBA history.

Usually when he takes over, he doesn\u2019t take over the game with his passing, he takes it over with his scoring (and sometimes takes over with his D as well). Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s his only objective, but it\u2019s his most elite trait, not because he\u2019s bad at other things, but because he\u2019s such a gifted scorer. His passing even makes his scoring more dangerous as he\u2019s going to kill you with if you double him etc.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t an elite passer. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t see how his passing overshadows his scoring - he\u2019s one of the top 10 most talented scorers in history IMO. Is he really one of the top 10 most talented passers? Maybe this is a bad comparison, but to me it seems like saying MJ\u2019s best trait was his defense - he was an elite defender and DPOY winner, but his scoring was more important too.\n\nI did forget about Magic with respect to all time greats. Magic was definitely not an \u201caverage\u201d scorer though, he was a pretty good scorer himself.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this stat isn\u2019t super impressive too, just saying that in my view LeBron\u2019s scoring is the best part of his game because he is so good at it (which doesn\u2019t seem like a knock on his game in any way whatsoever, but I guess the downvoters are interpreting it as such). I guess we can agree to disagree on this though.

That's amazing. \n\nRegarding Stata, I used it for grad school because political science departments want you to know how to use basic econometrics concepts for better analysis on topics, especially in comparative politic classes. It's a regression machine and amazing. I still need to learn R, but I really don't *need to* because Stata creates graphs and I can use Tableau Public as well for nicer ones. \n\nAnd regarding Ben, he should be able to give a great answer as to the \"what is a team?\" question because that's where the issue lies with either using random effects or simple OLS robust/ridge regression. Because if a team's identity does technically change year-over-year at a non-statistical level, Stata or R won't pick that up, but we need to account for that in terms of what regression we use. \n\nHowever, if we should treat a team as an individual entity no matter turnover, then we must panel team data and use random effects because this is time-series data we are talking about.
