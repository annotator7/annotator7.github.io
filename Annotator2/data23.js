This year I felt like I lost my identity after high school ended and I hate my studies because of my mind state. In my first year I devolved back into my depressed self since no one in the world gave an effort to include me in anything and the roommate situation this time last year was horrible. I lost touch (or so I thought) with all of my friends from high school, but I did have one friend in college to help guide me later on in the year but not much got better. I'm an aviation student but at the same time in my now going on 2 years in college I haven't flown one bit so I'm looking at taking a year off to rethink my life.\n\n\nThe lowest part of my life is when I went to the basketball courts at the recreation center with the intent to end it all later that night. It was then when I woke up in the head and realized that I needed to change my life once.\n\nIn a way basketball ended up saving my life. I realized that I didn't want to play for one last time and never give myself a chance to get better and because I knew I had a live to live for no matter how cloudy my future was.\n\n\nSo for you do what I did; force yourself into an uncomfortable situation. Attend clubs you might have never thought about before. Getting out there makes friends. Also, get into the inramural leagues for basketball. It'll give you more of a motivation to get mentally healthy for the game and in life by having a goal you reach for. And about the girls? For now forget about em. They just bring sadness everywhere you go if you try constantly looking for a partner. My best friend is a woman, so there's that, plus we're trying to get a place next year because our trust is so high for one another.\n\nI know this may not exactly relate to you, but it's the best relation and advice I got. I see you here all the time (and have friended) and I am wishing you the best. Stay in school as well or at least take a quarter off to rethink what you're doing school-wise.\n\n\nHappy holidays and merry Christmas to you!"}, {"id": "drhen45", "body": "In some ways I've had the same background as you.

In my first year I devolved back into my depressed self since no one in the world gave an effort to include me in anything and the roommate situation this time last year was horrible. I lost touch (or so I thought) with all of my friends from high school, but I did have one friend in college to help guide me later on in the year but not much got better. I'm an aviation student but at the same time in my now going on 2 years in college I haven't flown one bit so I'm looking at taking a year off to rethink my life.\n\n\nThe lowest part of my life is when I went to the basketball courts at the recreation center with the intent to end it all later that night. It was then when I woke up in the head and realized that I needed to change my life once.\n\nIn a way basketball ended up saving my life. I realized that I didn't want to play for one last time and never give myself a chance to get better and because I knew I had a live to live for no matter how cloudy my future was.\n\n\nSo for you do what I did; force yourself into an uncomfortable situation. Attend clubs you might have never thought about before. Getting out there makes friends. Also, get into the inramural leagues for basketball. It'll give you more of a motivation to get mentally healthy for the game and in life by having a goal you reach for. And about the girls? For now forget about em. They just bring sadness everywhere you go if you try constantly looking for a partner. My best friend is a woman, so there's that, plus we're trying to get a place next year because our trust is so high for one another.\n\nI know this may not exactly relate to you, but it's the best relation and advice I got. I see you here all the time (and have friended) and I am wishing you the best. Stay in school as well or at least take a quarter off to rethink what you're doing school-wise.\n\n\nHappy holidays and merry Christmas to you!"}, {"id": "dri7fqi", "body": "Oh well, I think weirdly enough we are having similar situations. I too have that one friend who keeps you up but unfortunately he's leaving from here (just the day after Christmas) and I may not be able to see him for a looong time.  \nAnd about college, the thing is I don't know.. I mean I can always study in my home and I don't know going to college is just stupid and takes a LOT of useful time because I really know most of the things they are teaching (like everything upto the final years &amp; I am not kidding) and find things really easy. So if I get that extra bit of time, I can indulge myself in other things, so I can make myself feel better while moving along with studies.  \n\nHappy Holidays : )"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7km5ef", "body": "#[/r/NBA Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/rules)\n\n###[Games of the Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/wiki/game_thread_generator)\n\nLinks to game threads of today's games are included in the above link (once they've been created).

Yes, athletes have done amazing things after coming back from injury compared to the general popular but there\u2019s huge confounding variables- they already have the most elite bodies/genetics which have gotten them to the NBA, and they have the top doctor, trainers, PTs, recovery etc. and when they\u2019re recovering it\u2019s their full time job, they don\u2019t need to worry about anything else in their professional lives which is hugely beneficial.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not safe for players to put on a bunch of weight/muscle all at once. Guys like KP and Ingram have specific 3+ year plans for how much weight to put on in the off season. Even if BI could put 25 lbs on his frame in one offseason that\u2019d be a really short sighted decision. Putting on the weight naturally and slowly is the best way to do it. Putting on a lot of muscle/mass would throw off all his mechanics which is not what they want. So using PEDs to put on muscle faster isn\u2019t really all that helpful either, unless guys don\u2019t want to work as hard, but most NBA players are in the league because they\u2019re workhorses who only know training hard and don\u2019t look for the easy way out. \n\nPED use is probably most common for injury recovery/prevention like I mentioned, but there\u2019s so many new techniques players are using which I think could curb PED use. Guys like Curry and Kobe have been big proponents of cold therapy, and there\u2019s tons of other injury prevention things- LBJ uses the balance ball things, plenty of players have turned to cupping, massages/naps are commonplace in the NBA now, and basically every player has the compression and cold heavy-duty sleeves for their legs. \n\nAnd while experimental, there\u2019s plenty of new treatments like using stem cells for regeneration, which are completely legal.\n\nI think that it\u2019s also far more likely guys will forego the PED route, and instead do things like travel to Germany for non-FDA approved procedures and recovery techniques, like how Kobe used to.
