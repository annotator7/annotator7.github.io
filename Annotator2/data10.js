One man teams don't consistently win 60+ games for consecutive years. \n\nPeople forget that this was an era where Dwight Howard and a bunch of role players in a good system made the finals.  \n\nTeams out east (minus Boston) didn't have more than one star player per team and the cavs were heavily favored to make the finals in 09 and 10 \n\nhttp://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2009/matchup/_/teams/magic-cavaliers\n\n(Middle right has the \"expert\" picks)\n\nThey were a 65 win team in 2009 and added Antwan Jaminson midway through the 2010 season in that bogus trade for big z that allowed big z to remain on the cavs (which the NBA later changed the rules to make sure never happened again) and added Shaq who had played really well for Phoenix in 2009. \n\nYou could get through the east in those days with one star player + a good system with good supporting players for that system and that's what the cavs had and why they were the favorites to make the finals those years. \n\nPeople forget the context as to why Lebron was hated so heavily for that decision to join the HEAT. \n\nHe wasn't leaving a lottery team or a 45-50 win team. He was leaving a team with b2b 60 win team who had been the favorites to make the finals for the past two seasons. \n\nI'm not trying to draw comparisons to what Durant did, but to act like Lebron left some YMCA  team is revisionist history.

Lebron literally said \"it's gonna be easy\" and rattled off the infamous \"not one, not two\" so I can't pretend like he wasn't aware that he was considerably stacking the deck in his favor by making the move to Miami. \n\nI think both guys left their respective teams after embarrassing losses in the playoffs the year before in an attempt to take the easiest possible route to a championship because the media pressure of \"win a ring to validate your greatness\" was getting to them.
