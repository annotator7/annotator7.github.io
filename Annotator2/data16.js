To make it even worse the article suggested that Lillard should've been even higher.\n\nMy third and for now final issue is how high Westbrook is. The list had Westbrook 11th which if the list was straight up best player would be to low. The list was best players only based on this season and this ranking was definitely impacted by Westbrook's MVP. This season Westbrook has been shooting 40% from the field and just under 33% from 3. His averages may be good but once you account for his teams record of 11-13 and him having Paul George and Carmelo Anthony on his team it is crazy to have him in the top 20.

Wasn\u2019t referring to \u201ctop prospects\u201d because there\u2019s no need for them to stay in college at all because a lot of them are \u201cnba ready\u201d or will translate into the nba better. I\u2019m not saying all players but players like Lillard, Wade, Jimmy (even though he was raw out of college), and Kawhi probably wouldn\u2019t have been lottery picks coming out their freshmen year. \n\nFor a player like Brandon Ingram who\u2019s a twig it makes sense for him to go straight to the nba cause he\u2019s going to be a top five pick and he was. But for players that are fringe lottery and first rounders it makes sense to stay in college and just develop your game, gain muscle and work on your craft. "}, {"id": "dqmv599", "body": "IF you're a fringe lottery / mid first rounder - you absolutely, without question, should goto the NBA. You get paid 7 figures and get access to some of the top athletic trainers, coaches, etc in the world. If you're an athlete who is confident and feel you can be a great player and can be in a position to pursue this, then the smartest thing to do is bet on your self and goto the NBA.\n\nIf you're a 2nd rounder with not much interest, then yeah, maybe you should stay another year and try to increase your draft stock.\n\n\nAgain, you're assuming that players that stay in college become better if they stay. Theres absolutely been 0 correlation to show that. For every Lillard that stays in college 4 years, you have a Kris Dunn who also stayed in college 4 years and looks raw. \n\nIf you were to analyze all the players across the board, regardless of where they were drafted, you'd find very little to no correlation.

The point I want to make here is that I feel it's not CRAZY to think a player could do well in real games when he performs well in summer league\n\n\nIt kinda bothers me now with Lonzo's struggles everyone is immediately bashing people for buying into the summer league hype of Lonzo.\n\nThe reason this bothers me is because the real hype in summer league was all about Kuzma lighting it up and look what he is doing. He has played honestly just as well in these real NBA games.\n\nAnother example is Donovan Mitchell who was incredible in summer league and has been arguably better since the season started.\n\n\nMy point is, yes, summer league is definitely different and no one plays defense. But at the end of the day, players who ball out in summer league have, for the most part, translated that game to the real NBA.\n\n\nAny thoughts/counter arguments?
