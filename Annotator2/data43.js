Should be noted that I haven\u2019t really watched the Sixers at all this year, but I have watched a few Nuggets games.\n\n\nPeople saying that Saric should be traded aren\u2019t realizing how important he is to the Embiid-less lineups on the Sixers. Even with TJ and Simmons, Saric is super important just for the offense to be able to function without Embiid. Maybe having Fultz will help a lot in that regard though.\n\n\nMurray is still having problems creating separation \u2026 twice in the third he got switches and took contested mid-range jumpers. Wasn\u2019t confident enough to attack Amir Johnson or Saric on switches. Still balled out today though.\n\n\nBen Simmons\u2019s defense is super underrated \u2026 big part of why he\u2019s a standout rookie. Haven\u2019t watched a ton of him on defense so this might be out-of-context but I really like what I see out of him defensively, especially considering that he\u2019s a rook.\n\n\nOn a side note, I really love the court design for the Nuggets. \n\n\nI hate these Plumlee-Jokic lineups, even though they have been somewhat effective while Millsap\u2019s been out. Would love to see more Lyles, Hernangomez, and even Faried at the 4 especially when the opposing team goes small and let Plumlee solely be the backup C.\n\n\nStill not too happy from what I see from Jokic on defense \u2026 slight improvement from last year but he\u2019s still a step behind on pick and rolls and missed a lot of rotations.\n\n\nTeams are paying attention to the Jokic to Harris connection \u2013 players are fighting harder around dribble handoffs and help is coming much sooner.\n\n\nLove the switch-up on a sideline inbounds play from the Sixers \u2013 when players are overplaying that pass to the point guard just goes for the oop \n\n\nHack-A-Plumlee?  1-7 from the line from the third. I would love to see some super small lineups with Faried at small-ball center for the Nuggets, especially against bigs like Johnson, Holmes, or Booker. Not a big fan of Plumlee.\n\n\nI wonder if blowing leads really does happen more often with younger teams \u2026 it definitely makes more sense but I would definitely be interested in looking at stats backing that up.\n\n\nDon\u2019t know how I feel about this super small lineup now that Holmes has fouled out. Saric Covington Simmons Bayless McConnell? I don\u2019t feel like the advantage offensively is enough to make up for the defensive loss. \n\n\nI definitely think bigs are not getting the fouls they deserve. Jokic did not really get the calls I thought he deserved against this super small Sixers lineup. But it\u2019s happened since the dawn of basketball and will continue happening. Bigs just have to learn how to play through some extra contact on switches. Interesting to see in this switch-heavy league how much the refs will allow though.\n\n\nThoughts on the game afterwards:\n\n\nI\u2019m really not a fan of Malone\u2019s rotations. He can\u2019t keep running with this 8-man rotation \u2013 He needs to get Jefferson, Mudiay, Faried, and Beasley even some some spot minutes to give Murray and Harris especially more rest\n\n\nLyles and Murray balling out for the Nuggets, Saric, Bayless, and TJ putting in the work for the Sixers.\nReally not sure what\u2019s happened to Chandler. Haven\u2019t seen enough of him this year but he seems really unconfident on offense. Did a great job against Simmons though on defense \u2013 who notably had a really off game tonight.\n\n\nIn the end a clutch W without Embiid that the Sixers needed in order to stay afloat in the playoff race. Haven\u2019t really watched much Sixers, but I really think Redick should be more than just a one-year rental for the Sixers \u2013 he gives them some much needed spacing. Great to see Holmes get some more minutes with Embiid out\u2013 was one of my favorite Sixers last year. He still really needs to work on those fouls though. 6 fouls in 19 minutes is not a good look and he would\u2019ve gotten those clutch minutes if he hadn\u2019t fouled out. Too eager for blocks and needs to stay on his feet more. A lot of questionable calls for him too though. \n\n\nFor the Nuggets, I would quick to blame this loss really on poor shooting, 7-32 from the 3, and the Nuggets missed so many good looks, including the Barton three that would\u2019ve tied it up with 21 seconds left. Still were a lot of things to improve on from them. Missed defensive rotations hurt them a lot, getting back on defense and getting the correct defensive matchups, and just some really bad offensive possessions when Jokic wasn\u2019t on the floor. \n"}, {"id": "drzfx76", "body": "Had some time so I sat down and watched the Sixers-Nuggets game and just jotted down a couple of notes and things that I noticed from the game.
