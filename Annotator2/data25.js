Never bad enough for a top 3 draft pick, never good enough for the playoffs. It truely is NBA hell. \n\nVogel is heiled as a defensive coach, but the Magic are 28th in points allowed this season and only 16th in offensive rating. You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep. Reddit's own Kevin O'Connor claimed that [Thibs needed \"an intervention\" in terms of redesigning how he distributes minutes and how he manages rotations.](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinoconnornba/status/938918459920080896)\n\nDespite all of this, the Wolves are winning. The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drv8c2f", "body": "I really don\u2019t think Thibs is on the hot seat.

All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep. Reddit's own Kevin O'Connor claimed that [Thibs needed \"an intervention\" in terms of redesigning how he distributes minutes and how he manages rotations.](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinoconnornba/status/938918459920080896)\n\nDespite all of this, the Wolves are winning. The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drv8c3l", "body": "Luke Walton?"}, {"id": "drv8c3l", "body": "Luke Walton?"}, {"id": "drv8hc9", "body": "I think the Lakers see things out with Walton, to be honest.

In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008.

Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep.

The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drv91ek", "body": "My guess is Clifford's probably gone at the end of the season if they continue on this barely 29-win pace.

Really, it does. Because a coach as bad as Kidd right now deserves recognition for being a terrible coach.

You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat?

I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep. Reddit's own Kevin O'Connor claimed that [Thibs needed \"an intervention\" in terms of redesigning how he distributes minutes and how he manages rotations.](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinoconnornba/status/938918459920080896)\n\nDespite all of this, the Wolves are winning. The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drv966g", "body": "Triano is not on the hot seat and even if he is replaced he will not be canned he will go back to assistant."}, {"id": "drv966g", "body": "Triano is not on the hot seat and even if he is replaced he will not be canned he will go back to assistant."}, {"id": "drv9dae", "body": "You're right, but when i say \"get canned\" i meant from the HC position."}, {"id": "drv9dae", "body": "You're right, but when i say \"get canned\" i meant from the HC position."}, {"id": "drv9gqc", "body": "either way he is not on the hot seat at all.\n\nthere is almost no scenario under which he gets canned before they evaluate the head coaching position in the offseason."}, {"id": "drv9gqc", "body": "either way he is not on the hot seat at all.\n\nthere is almost no scenario under which he gets canned before they evaluate the head coaching position in the offseason."}, {"id": "drvl9vi", "body": "He's keeping the seat warm, but it's probably not his seat."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mnm0s", "body": "\nAs we're about a third of the way into the season, some teams simply haven't been producing the output that is wanted by their respective FO's.

You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep.

The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drv99t7", "body": "It's a stretch to the say the Bucks have sputtered out of control, but Kidd does suck.

It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep.

The Wolves are winning for the first time in a very, very long time. And that carries a lot of weight in the NBA. While Thibs won't be fired soon, it's worth noting that he's still being evaluated and could be on the hot seat very soon. \n\n*Prediction: ?*\n\n**Honorable Mentions:**\n\nDave Joerger\nFred Hoiberg\n\n\nTL;DR: i wrote this entire thing on my phone on a train so read it.\n\n"}, {"id": "drvcdcm", "body": "Hoiberg is completely safe -- not an honorable mention.

Really, it does. Because a coach as bad as Kidd right now deserves recognition for being a terrible coach.

Never bad enough for a top 3 draft pick, never good enough for the playoffs. It truely is NBA hell. \n\nVogel is heiled as a defensive coach, but the Magic are 28th in points allowed this season and only 16th in offensive rating. You could look at that optimistically or pessimistically, and well, we're in a thread about firing coaches, so i'm going for the latter.\n\nThe crushing blow for Vogel is this, however: in the offseason, the Magic decided to hire both John Hammond and Jeff Weltman as GM and President of Basketball Operations, respectively. It is rare that a new front office overhaul keeps the current coach of the roster, especially when they're not winning. Especially when that coach is mediocre, which i believe Vogel is. I think that Magic can do better, but above all else i think Vogel is gone by the end of the season. No doubt.\n\n*Prediction: fired either during/immeditely after the season*\n\n**4: Doc Rivers (LAC)**\n\nThe basketball world has ultimately been clamoring for the Clippers to fire Doc Rivers ever since he was hired as both the head coach and the president of basketball operations. In late August of 2017, he was stripped of his title as POBO in order to focus on coaching the team. He's been criticized over the years for having goofy rotations, horribly predictable offenses, and having the uncanny ability to never get past the 2nd round after winning a championship in Boston in 2008. It's safe to assume that Doc is an okay head coach at best, but for the Clippers, the time is far overdue for a firing.\n\nNot only could Doc not win with a solid core of 2 hall of famers and an elite center, he couldn't even scrape the conference finals. Many times throughout the season he'll be found in interviews caring more about where his next round of golf will take place rather than where his next game is. All in all, all arrows point to saying that Doc *should* be fired. But will the Clippers actually fire him?\n\nThey should. The Clippers will not change if Doc is not fired. He's been there too long, and hasn't gotten the results that i would imagine Stebe Balmer is looking for in a head coach. A change of scenery would be a breath of fresh air for the Clippers, and i think the sooner they fire Doc, the sooner they'll be on the path back to the playoffs. \n\n*Prediction: fired in the offseason of 2018*\n\n**5: Steve Clifford (CHA)**\n\nI really hope this one isn't true, but we have to look at the evidence. Since Clifford signed an extension to his contract in 2015 that will keep him locked up until the end of the 2018-2019 season, the Hornets have made the playoffs once, exiting in the first round. This year, they look like two different animals at home vs when they're away, going 10-10 at home and 2-12 while on the road. With Clifford at the helm, the Hornets have been the same beast over the years, grinding out a slow paced offense based on pick and rolls as well as a physical brand of defense, despite some lapses in effort on the Hornet's part.\n\nI don't think the Hornets fire Clifford after this season, but 2017 is definitely a deciding year that will determine if they bring him back after his contract runs out. If the Hornets continue to look like *this*, then you can expect them to go elsewhere in 2019 when addressing the head coach position.\n\n*Prediction: Let go in 2019, not extended*\n\n**6: Tom Thibodeau (MIN)**\n\nIs it even possible for a winning coach to be on the hot seat? To be honest, i have my doubts. Winning truely is the solution to all of a franchises' problems, and the Wolves might make the playoffs for the first time in 14 years. Not only that, but Thibs is also the President of Basketball Operstions in Minnesota. Yikes. The last coach that was fired with a top record in the west was Kevin McHale in 2015, even afer making the conference finals. Why did the Rockets fire Kevin McHale, even after giving them the 2nd seed in the west? He wasn't a very good coach. His offensive game plan involved the team's best player (James Harden) iso until death. Defensively, the team was an even bigger mess, despite having Dwight Howard. \n\nTom Thibodeau isn't far off. While the Wolves are 4th in offensive rating, Thibs still hasn't righted the ship on defense, clocking in at 25th in DRtg. Despite their high offensive rating, many have criticized Thibs for calling too many iso plays and not having enough flow on offense. As Zach Lowe said on \"The Lowe Post\", \"[I've never seen a team run an offense like that and win in the playoffs. In the playoffs they'll come across better defenses that know how to stop that].\" Despite my awful paraphrasing, he's right. Teams that are predictable on offense tend to not go very far in the playoffs, and my prediction is that the Timberwolves will end up packing up to Cancun after the first round. \n\nDefensively, it couldn't really get much worse. This isn't really Thibs' fault, per se; the Wolves' roster he inherited simply did not have the personnel to play defense at a high level. However, being the POBO, Thibs did nothing tk address this problem in the offseason of 2017. He brough on players like Jeff Teague and Jamal Crawford, who definitely didn't help things. He traded for Jimmy Butler, one of the premier wing defenders in the league, but his efforts on defense can't save an entire squad. Not only this, but both [Karl Anthony-Towns and Andrew Wiggins were called \"The worst defenders at their position\" by 538.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-haters-ball/amp/)\n\nAll of the above included, Thibs' demons from the past come back to haunt him once again in his worst offense yet: his minute dispersion. His entire career, Tom Thibodeau has been crucified for overplaying his starters to the point of exhaustion. The living proof is there: Luol Deng being washed up on the Lakers, Joakim Noah being broken down on the Knicks, and Derrick Rose being in and out of the league. His rotations are paper thin, most of the time playing 8 guys at a time during a game. The worst offense was [when Thibs made his starteds play over 40 minutes a piece in an overtime bout with the Grizzlies, on a back to back.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theringer.com/platform/amp/nba/2017/12/6/16742082/minnesota-timberwolves-tom-thibodeau-jimmy-butler-fatigue)Yep.
