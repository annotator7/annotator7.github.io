The people who came first are absolutely crucial to creating the talent of today, but in a vacuum today's teams/performers etc should be better than in the past.

Here is a list of weaknesses he has that are extremely tough to cover up and are also hard to improve:\nHe can't shoot at all. After showing some flashes in this regard his rookie year he added this horrendous hitch to his motion. I'll always remember the three he hit in the rising stars game but I truly believe it's a lost cause He shoots around 30% everywhere outside outside of 3 feet for his career.\nHe's a terrible rebounder. This is a bigger problem than you think. If you're going to go with a big lineup with a guy like Jahlil, you better be able to punish the other team on the boards. Other teams can put smaller lineups out there which kill Jahlil on the other end without worrying about getting out-rebounded. People like to optimistically compare Jahlil to guys like Monroe and Kanter, but both far superior rebounders (in addition to being better in most other areas), and rebounding is one of the stats that statistically is least likely to improve in time.\nHe does not get easy garbage points. Since he's a terrible rebounder, he doesn't usually get putbacks, and he's too unathletic to catch lobs. These are high efficiency opportunities that most centers can provide. If you want Jahlil to score you need to throw him the ball close to the hoop with the understanding that it's not coming back out, and that it's likely only a 40% proposition that he scores. This is another area where Kanter/Monroe are elite and Jahlil is terrible.\nJoelEmbeast said it best: Passing: Jahlil is a terrible passer. He gets the ball in the post, palms it for a couple seconds, puts his head down, and at no point considers the other 4 players around him wearing the same uniform. This is a massive flaw since his only role on offense really is as a suito-focal point because if you're not using him as your primary offensive option, it's not worth having him out there on defense.\nAthleticism: He's really slow, a really bad leaper and isn't as strong as you think. He's looked way worse in this regard since the meniscus tear he suffered at the end of his rookie year. His conditioning is also terrible. He's out of breath in like 2 minutes every time.\nDefensive IQ: He just doesn't understand how to play defense. He's never in the right position, and sometimes if he gets burnt he'll start \"trying,\" which usually means he's just going to foul the person he's guarding for a few possessions before going back to his lackadaisical approach. Think Karl Towns but he's slower so he's never even close to recovering from his mental mistakes.\nPick and Roll Defense: He's just too slow to guard the pick and roll, not to mention he doesn't try. More on that...\nEffort: This is his least redeemable quality. He just doesn't care. He doesn't try on defense or even pretend to, and he doesn't try on offense unless the ball is in his hands, and even then he sometimes takes the lazy way out with a contested fall away jumper that never goes in instead of taking it strong to the rack. This is why I never felt that bad for him when he was complaining about the playing time. If it was Richaun that was complaining about being buried on the roster (which he was without complaint despite being a blatantly better player), I would be sympathetic because that dude gives it everything he's got every time he's on the floor. Jahlil blatantly didn't give a shit when he was on the floor. If he can't put forth the effort in games, why should I believe that he's putting forth the effort in practice?\nIt's worth mentioning that in the NBA, his teams have been way better with him off the court. Think about this: during Jahlil's rookie season which people point to as proof he can become something great, the 2015-16 76ers (who were one of the worst teams of all time and had no scorers apart from him) were WAY worse on both sides of the ball when he was on the floor. Some fans argue that his contribution was the only reason that team was historically bad rather than normal bad, since they had like a 25 wins point differential with him off the court. Even in college, his team was way better with him off the court (Duke fans called it the Okafor effect), and Coach K cut Jah's minutes in the tournament when he was getting exploited.\nTo be fair here, I will mention his strengths:\nElite touch within a couple feet of the rim\nVery footwork to make his way to the basket\nBetter than you would think at rim protection when his is in position just by virtue of being a big body with good length.\nIf you ask me how I think his time with the Nets will go, I think Jahlil may put up some empty stats for the Nets and some people will will laugh at the 76ers because the Nets got him for free, but it won't change his insurmountable flaws. I also think he's also an especially bad fit for the Nets who are looking to play extremely fast with an egalitarian offense, and I highly doubt he's wearing a Nets uniform next season."}, {"id": "dqz015r", "body": "JoelEmbeast said it best: [Serious] I think he'll be a terrible player for the Nets because I truly think he's always been deeply flawed to the point that he needs multiple major developments as a player to even become roster worthy on a playoff team.
