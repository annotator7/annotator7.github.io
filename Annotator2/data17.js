For this comparison, I looked at Harden, Thompson, Beal, and DeRozan specifically.  I excluded McCollum because he entered the league in his age-22 season.\n\nHere is the detailed stats: http://bkref.com/tiny/sq07b\n\nKey stats that stand out:\n\n- Booker is 1st in points per game at 24.3, 7.1 better than the # 2 spot (DeRozan)\n\n- Booker is 1st in rebounds per game at 4.5, 0.7 ahead of Beal and DeRozan; he also has the highest rebound rate\n\n- Booker is 1st in assists per game at 4.1, 1.0 ahead of Beal; he also has the highest assist rate\n\n- Booker's eFG% is  51.9%, barely behind Klay Thompson's 52.0%.  His TS% is 57.3%, 2nd behind Harden's  59.8%.\n\n- For other fans of advanced stats, Booker's PER is 19.4, 3 points better than the 2nd place Harden.  He already has as many win shares (1.7) through 25 games that Thompson had in 66 games.  His WS/48 .097 is 2nd only to Harden's .156. Also, VORP of 0.6 has already eclipsed what Thompson and DeRozan achieved that year in 66 and 82 games, respectively.\n\nThe evidence points to the fact that Booker is arguably more advanced than any of the league's top shooting guards in their age-21 season.  His volume, efficiency, and overall contribution to the team is at the top of the group. Granted, Booker also has the highest usage % among these players, but he does not necessarily have the same weapons around him.\n\nStack Booker up against these same players today and you'll see he matches up quite nicely - 2nd in PPG and RPG, and 3rd in APG.  Averages more steals than Thompson and more blocks than DeRozan.  TS% 3rd to Harden and Thompson.  \n\nThe big takeaway though, is that Harden, DeRozan, Thompson, and Beal are putting up these numbers in their 9th, 9th, 7th, and 6th seasons respectively.

For this comparison, I looked at Harden, Thompson, Beal, and DeRozan specifically.  I excluded McCollum because he entered the league in his age-22 season.\n\nHere is the detailed stats: http://bkref.com/tiny/sq07b\n\nKey stats that stand out:\n\n- Booker is 1st in points per game at 24.3, 7.1 better than the # 2 spot (DeRozan)\n\n- Booker is 1st in rebounds per game at 4.5, 0.7 ahead of Beal and DeRozan; he also has the highest rebound rate\n\n- Booker is 1st in assists per game at 4.1, 1.0 ahead of Beal; he also has the highest assist rate\n\n- Booker's eFG% is  51.9%, barely behind Klay Thompson's 52.0%.  His TS% is 57.3%, 2nd behind Harden's  59.8%.\n\n- For other fans of advanced stats, Booker's PER is 19.4, 3 points better than the 2nd place Harden.  He already has as many win shares (1.7) through 25 games that Thompson had in 66 games.  His WS/48 .097 is 2nd only to Harden's .156. Also, VORP of 0.6 has already eclipsed what Thompson and DeRozan achieved that year in 66 and 82 games, respectively.\n\nThe evidence points to the fact that Booker is arguably more advanced than any of the league's top shooting guards in their age-21 season.  His volume, efficiency, and overall contribution to the team is at the top of the group. Granted, Booker also has the highest usage % among these players, but he does not necessarily have the same weapons around him.\n\nStack Booker up against these same players today and you'll see he matches up quite nicely - 2nd in PPG and RPG, and 3rd in APG.  Averages more steals than Thompson and more blocks than DeRozan.  TS% 3rd to Harden and Thompson.  \n\nThe big takeaway though, is that Harden, DeRozan, Thompson, and Beal are putting up these numbers in their 9th, 9th, 7th, and 6th seasons respectively.  Booker is only in year 3 of his career at age 21.  The next youngest guy in this list, Beal, is 3 years older at age 24.  \n\n"}, {"id": "dr4555e", "body": "What\u2019s the perfect group of guys around him?
