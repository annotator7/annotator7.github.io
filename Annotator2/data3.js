Now we get into the team accomplishments determining a players career regardless of context. Payton and Kidd won their rings at the back end of their careers on two of the best examples of the best player carrying the team (Wade and Dirk) ever. Kidds other Finals appearances were in a terrible Eastern conference. I could argue that people misinterpret overachieving with underachieving. He took 2 of the biggest clown shoe organizations in basketball and made them relevant. He revitalized careers like Peja and JJ, turned David West into an All Star, and DeAndre Jordan into an All NBA player. He's never been on a team that hasn't had serious holes. The OKC turnover despite being right in the middle of the Sterling fiasco to the point fans were pressuring them to sit out the series in protest was horrible and all on him. But he is literally statistically one of the most clutch players in the playoffs.
