Yes, he can be a cancer but at the end of the day a guys who can average 28-12-5-2-1 in his sleep is a superstar.\n\nSubtract Horford, add Cousins and the Celtics are the best team in the east but still you will see that argumant made, it's crazy.\n\nIt reminds me of prime Joakim being put ahead of Bynum back in the day when Bynum was a 19-11-3-2 guy."}, {"id": "dqw82vi", "body": "I see...

This was just a quick attempt so don't take this as 100% accurate, but feel safe to assume these are close to accurate. I have the same amount of comebacks as blown leads, so if i missed anything i just totally skipped it. Enough rambling, here is the table. Tables are separated by conference and organized alphabetically.\n\nThe East\n\nTeam | Blown leads | 20+ leads | Comebacks\n----|-----------|---------|---------\nATL | 4 | 1 | 2\nBOS | 2 |  | 8\nBRK | 5 |  | 2\nCHA | 6 |  | 5\nCHI | 4 |  | 4\nCLE | 1 |  | 7\nDET | 1 |  | 7\nIND | 4 |  | 4\nMIA | 3 |  | 4\nMIL | 3 |  | 6\nNY | 5 | 3 | 8\nORL | 4 |  | 2\nPHI | 6 | 2 | 0\nTOR | 4 |  | 4\nWAS | 7 | 1 | 4\n\nThe West\n\n\nTeam | Blown leads | 20+ leads | Comebacks\n----|-----------|---------|---------\nDAL | 11 |  | 1\nDEN | 5 |  | 5\nGS | 4 |  | 8\nHOU | 4 | 1 | 5\nLAC | 2 |  | 5\nLAL | 2 |  | 2\nMEM | 10 | 1 | 3\nMIN | 4 | 1 | 5\nNO | 7 | 1 | 6\nOKC | 8 | 1 | 4\nPHO | 2 |  | 3\nPOR | 4 |  | 5\nSA | 2 |  | 4\nSAC | 5 |  | 6\nUTAH | 3 |  | 3\n\nSo, lets see what we can take away from these tables. \n\nFirst thing of note - The west sucks at holding leads. The west averages 4.8 blown double digit leads per team, to the east's 3.9. The west is hurt a lot by the three worst teams in the league at holding leads, Memphis, Dallas, and OKC, all being in the West. OKC has been improving lately, as they were tied for first on the 8th of December and have since moved down to 3rd, but Memphis has been getting a lot worse to compensate.  \n\nNext, lets talk about those bottom 3 - OKC, Memphis, and Dallas. For OKC and Memphis fans, this is pure frustration i am sure. Two teams built to win now (only one of which is succeeding) who can't hold leads. OKC seems to have figured it out, but Memphis has been getting worse at this recently. As for Dallas, this is probably actually a good thing. This team is tanking right now, and all these blown leads means that this young Dallas team is taking double digit leads at points. This implies they are competitive in their losses, without hurting the tank. \n\nSo who makes the least sense? For the sake of interesting basketball, I enjoy seeing a game with lots of swings in momentum. If you are with me in this boat, check out some Knicks games. They have blown the most 20 point leads in the league, and are also tied for the most comebacks in the league! I don't get how they can be both simultaneously, but the numbers don't lie. Other interesting teams are New Orleans, who are tied with NY for the most entries but have less 20+ point leads blown, Golden State, with 8 comebacks and 4 blown leads, and OKC, who have gone from blowing leads early in the year, to coming back to win recently.\n\nSo, if teams that lead to a lot of momentum swings are fun, that would mean that teams that don't have any are boring. So what teams are boring according to the table? The LA Lakers, surprisingly enough, take this crown. With just 2 blown leads and 2 comebacks, they have the least entries in the table. They also have a fun young core in Lonzo, BI, and Kuzma, so maybe the table doesn't really tell you who is boring... Anyways, other boring teams include the Suns, Spurs, Jazz, Hawks, and Magic. \n\nWhat about some comeback Kings? Unsurprisingly, Boston and GS, two contenders, are tied for the top. Surprisingly, though, they are tied with the Knicks, a team that is under .500. I don't get it. Just trailing behind are Detroit and Cleveland, both of whom are tied for the best ratio of blown leads to comebacks (1:7). Detroit was the leader in comebacks early in the year, but as they have slipped closer to .500, their comeback wins have dried up.\n\nHere are some other dumb notes i took while compiling this table. They don't deserve their own paragraphs, but i find them interesting. \n\nPhilly is the only team in the league to never come back from down 10 or more. If they start to fall behind, may as well turn them off. Cleveland was the last team in the league to blow a double digit lead. They lost to the bucks on 12/19 to blow their first. The largest lead blown that i could find was Philly blowing a 24 point lead to Golden State. And, in the weirdest mark of this table, Indy have blown only 4 games, 3 of which came in an 8 day stretch of early November. Was someone hurt in that stretch? \n\nSo, in conclusion, NBA teams occasionally blow leads. Some teams do this more than others. Sorry for the walls of text. I did this out of curiosity. Formatting just seemed like it would take too much time.\n\nEdit - on mobile but i forgot that houston blew the largest lead at 26 points, not philly\u2019s 24"}, {"id": "drxasgp", "body": "Nice!

This was just a quick attempt so don't take this as 100% accurate, but feel safe to assume these are close to accurate. I have the same amount of comebacks as blown leads, so if i missed anything i just totally skipped it. Enough rambling, here is the table. Tables are separated by conference and organized alphabetically.\n\nThe East\n\nTeam | Blown leads | 20+ leads | Comebacks\n----|-----------|---------|---------\nATL | 4 | 1 | 2\nBOS | 2 |  | 8\nBRK | 5 |  | 2\nCHA | 6 |  | 5\nCHI | 4 |  | 4\nCLE | 1 |  | 7\nDET | 1 |  | 7\nIND | 4 |  | 4\nMIA | 3 |  | 4\nMIL | 3 |  | 6\nNY | 5 | 3 | 8\nORL | 4 |  | 2\nPHI | 6 | 2 | 0\nTOR | 4 |  | 4\nWAS | 7 | 1 | 4\n\nThe West\n\n\nTeam | Blown leads | 20+ leads | Comebacks\n----|-----------|---------|---------\nDAL | 11 |  | 1\nDEN | 5 |  | 5\nGS | 4 |  | 8\nHOU | 4 | 1 | 5\nLAC | 2 |  | 5\nLAL | 2 |  | 2\nMEM | 10 | 1 | 3\nMIN | 4 | 1 | 5\nNO | 7 | 1 | 6\nOKC | 8 | 1 | 4\nPHO | 2 |  | 3\nPOR | 4 |  | 5\nSA | 2 |  | 4\nSAC | 5 |  | 6\nUTAH | 3 |  | 3\n\nSo, lets see what we can take away from these tables. \n\nFirst thing of note - The west sucks at holding leads. The west averages 4.8 blown double digit leads per team, to the east's 3.9. The west is hurt a lot by the three worst teams in the league at holding leads, Memphis, Dallas, and OKC, all being in the West. OKC has been improving lately, as they were tied for first on the 8th of December and have since moved down to 3rd, but Memphis has been getting a lot worse to compensate.  \n\nNext, lets talk about those bottom 3 - OKC, Memphis, and Dallas. For OKC and Memphis fans, this is pure frustration i am sure. Two teams built to win now (only one of which is succeeding) who can't hold leads. OKC seems to have figured it out, but Memphis has been getting worse at this recently. As for Dallas, this is probably actually a good thing. This team is tanking right now, and all these blown leads means that this young Dallas team is taking double digit leads at points. This implies they are competitive in their losses, without hurting the tank. \n\nSo who makes the least sense? For the sake of interesting basketball, I enjoy seeing a game with lots of swings in momentum. If you are with me in this boat, check out some Knicks games. They have blown the most 20 point leads in the league, and are also tied for the most comebacks in the league! I don't get how they can be both simultaneously, but the numbers don't lie. Other interesting teams are New Orleans, who are tied with NY for the most entries but have less 20+ point leads blown, Golden State, with 8 comebacks and 4 blown leads, and OKC, who have gone from blowing leads early in the year, to coming back to win recently.\n\nSo, if teams that lead to a lot of momentum swings are fun, that would mean that teams that don't have any are boring. So what teams are boring according to the table? The LA Lakers, surprisingly enough, take this crown. With just 2 blown leads and 2 comebacks, they have the least entries in the table. They also have a fun young core in Lonzo, BI, and Kuzma, so maybe the table doesn't really tell you who is boring... Anyways, other boring teams include the Suns, Spurs, Jazz, Hawks, and Magic. \n\nWhat about some comeback Kings? Unsurprisingly, Boston and GS, two contenders, are tied for the top. Surprisingly, though, they are tied with the Knicks, a team that is under .500. I don't get it. Just trailing behind are Detroit and Cleveland, both of whom are tied for the best ratio of blown leads to comebacks (1:7). Detroit was the leader in comebacks early in the year, but as they have slipped closer to .500, their comeback wins have dried up.\n\nHere are some other dumb notes i took while compiling this table. They don't deserve their own paragraphs, but i find them interesting. \n\nPhilly is the only team in the league to never come back from down 10 or more. If they start to fall behind, may as well turn them off. Cleveland was the last team in the league to blow a double digit lead. They lost to the bucks on 12/19 to blow their first. The largest lead blown that i could find was Philly blowing a 24 point lead to Golden State. And, in the weirdest mark of this table, Indy have blown only 4 games, 3 of which came in an 8 day stretch of early November. Was someone hurt in that stretch? \n\nSo, in conclusion, NBA teams occasionally blow leads. Some teams do this more than others. Sorry for the walls of text. I did this out of curiosity. Formatting just seemed like it would take too much time.\n\nEdit - on mobile but i forgot that houston blew the largest lead at 26 points, not philly\u2019s 24"}, {"id": "drxb62t", "body": "Dallas is tank gang"}, {"id": "drxb62t", "body": "Dallas is tank gang"}, {"id": "drxdyrd", "body": "Just have to look competitive "}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mx0tt", "body": "I was bored and had a bit of free time, so i went to NBA.com and painstakingly attempted to tally every game in which a team took a double digit lead at any point and lost.
