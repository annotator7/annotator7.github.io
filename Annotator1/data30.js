I remember a bunch of people waiting by the door hoping to catch a glimpse of the players as they left practice heading for the bus. Didn't get to see Bron or Wade, but said hello to Bosh, Chalmers, Norris Cole, and Shane Battier. Intermingled with the players were some assistant coaches and trainers and some TNT staff.

He turns to me, and walks over and shakes my hand.\n\nThe next five or ten minutes are just of him chatting with me about suits, how school was going, the matchup, what sport I played (I ran cross country and track), and what I wanted to do once I graduated. I was so taken aback by how genuine and nice he was. He didn't look for ways to leave the conversation, he asked me actual questions and told me all about what suit he was going to wear for the game that night, because he didn't think the suit he had on was good enough for TV.\n\nEventually he did have to get on with the rest of his day, but he offered another firm handshake goodbye, posed for a picture, and then sauntered out to the bus. The entire rest of the day I couldn't stop smiling and telling people how I had just had a chat with Craig as if he was my cool uncle.\n\nI'll never forget that day and the kindness he showed me, so when he eventually passed, his death hit harder than any other celebrity death because I felt like I had a real connection with him, even though I only spoke to him once for less than 10 minutes.\n\nRIP Craig, you were truly one of the very best\n\nEDIT: in case anybody needs/wants proof,\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/z30Y9ogcmD/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=captainhennessy21\n"}, {"id": "draotie", "body": "Meeting this guy my freshman year will forever be one of my greatest memories of college.\n\nIt was during the Heat/Bucks series when Brandon Jennings gave us the great \"Bucks in six\" quote.

I remember a bunch of people waiting by the door hoping to catch a glimpse of the players as they left practice heading for the bus. Didn't get to see Bron or Wade, but said hello to Bosh, Chalmers, Norris Cole, and Shane Battier. Intermingled with the players were some assistant coaches and trainers and some TNT staff. After standing there for about 10 minutes gawking at these celebs, I get ready to leave when none other than the man himself, Craig Sager, walks out of the elevator.\n\nI was super nervous but figured I might as well say something to him as he's leaving, it's Craig sager, so I called out \"Mr. Sager, that's a great suit you have on\" or something like that. He turns to me, and walks over and shakes my hand.\n\nThe next five or ten minutes are just of him chatting with me about suits, how school was going, the matchup, what sport I played (I ran cross country and track), and what I wanted to do once I graduated. I was so taken aback by how genuine and nice he was. He didn't look for ways to leave the conversation, he asked me actual questions and told me all about what suit he was going to wear for the game that night, because he didn't think the suit he had on was good enough for TV.\n\nEventually he did have to get on with the rest of his day, but he offered another firm handshake goodbye, posed for a picture, and then sauntered out to the bus. The entire rest of the day I couldn't stop smiling and telling people how I had just had a chat with Craig as if he was my cool uncle.\n\nI'll never forget that day and the kindness he showed me, so when he eventually passed, his death hit harder than any other celebrity death because I felt like I had a real connection with him, even though I only spoke to him once for less than 10 minutes.\n\nRIP Craig, you were truly one of the very best\n\nEDIT: in case anybody needs/wants proof,\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/z30Y9ogcmD/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=captainhennessy21\n"}, {"id": "dratz1e", "body": "Awesome story!
