It's kind of in their best interest to coast and rest players as much as they can because you're right about the regular season being meaningless, in essence.

Against teams that are above .500 though, Warriors will probably struggle more if they don't get their guys back before those games.

His rookie season not-so-much, but he was a full year and 5 months younger during said season ans was playing through 2 sports hernias.\n\nHe is an excellent finisher and can score in a plethora of ways.  His shot is pure and he is crafty and more athletic than advertised.   He started the season out very inconsistent but is averaging averaging 19 ppg on 48% in the two weeks since Jokic went down.  And that's despite a game where he pulled his calf muscle and put up only two points.  His 3 ball has struggled with extreme streakness as a pro, but his FT percentage is 4th highest in the NBA (s/t like .94) and when he gets hot, he doesn't miss.  So I have no doubt that will come around.  \n\nMurray can easily become an 25 ppg scorer with an elite outside shot who scores efficiently while playing above average D.    Though obviously, I think Mitchell will be the better defender and has a TON of upside too. "}, {"id": "drc505u", "body": "why are you talking about them in college?

Cause as I already said, Murray was a year and a half younger during his rookie season (and playing through 2 sports hernias).\n\nMitchell is averaging 17.8 on .417 while playing 30.2 minutes a game and being asked to be the primary scorer on a team lacking in them.   Murray is averaging 14.9 on .438 while playing 27.6 minutes and serving as a 3rd or even 4th offensive option because the Nuggets have that luxury.   They both have a bunch of games where they scored 20-30 pts.\n\nAnd when I say easily, I mean it's not far fetched that he becomes a 25 ppg scorer.   Thus, *ceiling*.

The guy has been putting up monster numbers lately (23.8ppg, 14.3rpg, 3.3bpg over his last 4) with highlight reel dunks, hooks, and blocks and almost looking like the athlete of old.  I've seen comments suggesting he is an all-star candidate, which might indeed be the case. Even lots of people on the Hornets sub (you know, who actually watch all his games) think he's been balling out. But the thing is, advanced stats *hate* him.  WS/48, BPM, and VORP all have him posting career lows, yes even lower than his age 19 rookie year.  And the thing is, people who've watched him are *divided* on the guy, which is exactly what you claim never happens to people who watch games.\n\nI'm not saying analytics are airtight, but they often point us in extremely useful directions that we may not have noticed otherwise. In Dwight's case, one can extrapolate that a big factor is his godawful 1 to 3 assist to turnover ratio, as well as his near career high usage rate while shooting a career low TS%. I did some further digging, and found that [no player has ever posted such high usage and turnover rates along with such a low assist rate](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;qual=mp_per_g_req&amp;c1stat=usg_pct&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=26&amp;c2stat=ast_pct&amp;c2comp=lt&amp;c2val=7&amp;c3stat=tov_pct&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=19&amp;order_by=ws).  So the analytics point in a direction and then we can start to see what makes Dwight so ineffective.  These may be things you suspect but are extremely difficult to quantify without looking at numbers.\n\nJust as an aside, turnover rate often factors in hugely in analytics, and is probably a big reason people often differ in opinions with what the numbers tell us. Tracking turnovers usefully (i.e., a Chris Paul turnover is less meaningful than an Anthony Davis one) just isn't a common instinct among basketball watchers, but it's been shown to have a huge effect."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7izoen", "body": "Would he be able to play in all 7/would the sixers let him? \nThe format for playoffs is like this: Game 1, rest, Game 2, rest, rest, Game 3, rest, Game 4, rest, rest, Game 5, rest, Game 6, rest, Game 7.
