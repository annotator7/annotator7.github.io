I logged into NBA League Pass and as I already knew Cavalier games are blacked out, yup blacked out.\n\nSo the reason its blacked out is because the game is on regional Fox Sports Ohio. Cool, well since we are in Pittsburgh we formerly had Fox Sports Pittsburgh, which never showed Cavalier games. I believe it has since been renamed to AT&amp;T Sports Net Pittsburgh.\n\nhttps://www.foxsports.com/ohio/story/fox-sports-ohio-channel-finder-121113 - The only option for PA is for a channel in Erie, PA.\n\nAT&amp;T Sports Net Pittsburgh does not offer the Cavalier games.\nhttps://pittsburgh-attsn.att.com/\n\nThe NBA chat representative confirmed that I do not have an option to watch the Cavalier games. \n\nI apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, we don't have any control or any access to bypass blackout games. Because blackout restrictions exist because local and national broadcasting companies have exclusive rights to block a live content. The only way to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers game is through a local channel which is located inside cleveland.\n\nDoes anyone have a League Pass Zip Code that gives you access to all 30 teams?\n\nI've read that NBA International has 0 blackouts. This is great, so I can't even watch a game, legally, over multiple purchased options (LP, NBA TV) for a game 2 hours away, but someone across the world can watch it? \n\nSolid business model, NBA. So you are forcing people to not pay for your services, but use the money for a VPN and sign up for international league pass instead?\n\nhttp://www.nba.com/leaguepass/blackouts - Explore Blackouts Zip Code Button at the bottom."}, {"id": "dr9nnoz", "body": "I had the same issue with Cavs games on NBA TV.
