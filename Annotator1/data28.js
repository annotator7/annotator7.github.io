Also, Markky + RoLo gives us a good defensive frontcourt that is bigger than most frontcourts and can make it rain when Markky is feeling it. Then, Niko might be a 6MOY candidate and Bobby and Nwaba are 2 of the better bench players in the league right now. Lastly Grant's not bad for a backup point guard, he's 6'5 can shoot a little, pretty athletic and our 10th man is Zipser who's starting to play better. The reason we sucked so much early in the season is because Felicio is garbage that was eaten, digested, shit out and eaten again, Pondexter is too old/injured to play well, and Niko was injured which put too much pessure on Markky.
