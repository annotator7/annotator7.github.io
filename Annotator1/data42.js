Most people here aren\u2019t designers or anything, obviously, and aren\u2019t going to say anything past \u201cwow these are ugly\u201d.\n\nI think that the handling of the type faces for the work marks are good. They look professional. The color choice on both is very different, which I believe is the root cause of the negative reactions, but whenever a new jersey with a drastic change in color from the original branding is released it is typically met with negative reactions due to unfamiliarity.\n\nThe warriors ones are cool. I like the over designs of Cleveland and Toronto. I like the arrow pointing north, it is simple clean and subtle but it isnt like it is beating you over the head with it. The Land is fine but nothing about it stands out as amazing but at the same time nothing about it is steaming horse shit like everyone is saying."}, {"id": "dr6e9a0", "body": "I mean its not really a great picture to judge.
