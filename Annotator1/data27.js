[This Atlantic article paints that picture really well, but there's one thing they don't point out.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/) The lowest quintile income in 2011 after tax was 24.6k, and the highest quintile was 245.7k.

Keep in mind that the average federal tax in the US for the lowest quintile was 500 dollars while for the top quintile it was 57.5k, and those tax dollars largely fund programs directly benefiting those lower quintile groups as well.

You want to paint the wealthy as selfish, go ahead, but the numbers would disagree with you. Charity is awesome, regardless of whomever does it. But if someone came up to your face and started bitching about how selfish you were because you didn't meet that person's expectation of charitable giving, you'd tell him to fuck off, because it's none of his business.

[This Atlantic article paints that picture really well, but there's one thing they don't point out.](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/why-the-rich-dont-give/309254/) The lowest quintile income in 2011 after tax was 24.6k, and the highest quintile was 245.7k. So the article points out that the top 20% only give 1.3% while the lowest 20% give 3.2%, but in actually dollars, that's 3.19k to 787 dollars. Keep in mind that the average federal tax in the US for the lowest quintile was 500 dollars while for the top quintile it was 57.5k, and those tax dollars largely fund programs directly benefiting those lower quintile groups as well.

They also give every player 2 in season \"random\" (read: whenever they want) drug tests and 2 out of season \"random\" drug tests. These tests are extremely difficult to pass. If you don't believe me, look at all the Olympians that got retroactively popped from the 2012 Olympics recently. Many of those athletes had entire countries helping them pass the tests but that still wasn't enough. However, I'm not sure if wada actually does the testing, or if the NBA does the testing and just uses the wada ban list. If that is the case, an athlete could be popped for something but the NBA wouldn't necessarily have to release that information if they didn't want to(aka they still want to make money off of their stars). This is the case in the NFL, if they wanted to, they could suspend basically everyone in the league bar the kickers. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that these guys truly are genetic freaks, both in their explosiveness, and their build. (Just look how long their arms are compared to their body). This doesn't mean they are or aren't on drugs, it's just something to consider when comparing ANY NBA player to a regular dude, or even a collegiate athlete. \n\nAdditionally, I would say that any PED use in the NBA is not for muscle mass, so things like testosterone, tren, dbol, anadrol, superdrol, etc and other things that we typically think of as \"sterpids\" that put insane amounts of muscle on you wouldn't really do anything for an nba player. Additionally, no NBA player has enough muscle to warrant suspicion of anabolics. Sure LeBron and Dwight and Blake Griffin are muscular, but they don't look anything like clay Mathews or any NBA defensive end. The only ped use I could see would be mild dosages of anabolic agents like clenbuterol or anavar in order to gain strength without necessarily gaining huge amounts of muscle. These drugs would also improve joint and tendon strength and because no nba player is lifting very heavy weights, the typical risks with these drugs are limited. Another possibility is taking the same drugs that a cyclist would take to improve or maintain endurance. I could see this as much more common than typical anabolics.\n\nLast point. No drug can give you Steph currys shot, or kyrie handle or draymonds defensive instincts, or LeBrons BBIQ. And for that reason I don't think there would be much of a difference in who the champion is every year whether the league is full of drugs or completely clean.\n\nWITH ALL THAT BEING SAID\n\nthere are PEDs in chess, orchestra, and many many sports that have very limited money at stake, so to think that there isn't some level of drug use is completely naive. \n\nI would say that whether it's 10% of the league or 90%, you definitely can't assume that someone is on based off what they look like, many of the guys who use are probably 8th-12th guys in the rotation.\n\n"}, {"id": "dqzd47g", "body": "Here's my response to all PED posts\n\nOk, afaik the NBA uses the wada/usada ban substances list which is about as stringent as you can get. They also give every player 2 in season \"random\" (read: whenever they want) drug tests and 2 out of season \"random\" drug tests. These tests are extremely difficult to pass. If you don't believe me, look at all the Olympians that got retroactively popped from the 2012 Olympics recently. Many of those athletes had entire countries helping them pass the tests but that still wasn't enough. However, I'm not sure if wada actually does the testing, or if the NBA does the testing and just uses the wada ban list. If that is the case, an athlete could be popped for something but the NBA wouldn't necessarily have to release that information if they didn't want to(aka they still want to make money off of their stars). This is the case in the NFL, if they wanted to, they could suspend basically everyone in the league bar the kickers. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that these guys truly are genetic freaks, both in their explosiveness, and their build. (Just look how long their arms are compared to their body). This doesn't mean they are or aren't on drugs, it's just something to consider when comparing ANY NBA player to a regular dude, or even a collegiate athlete. \n\nAdditionally, I would say that any PED use in the NBA is not for muscle mass, so things like testosterone, tren, dbol, anadrol, superdrol, etc and other things that we typically think of as \"sterpids\" that put insane amounts of muscle on you wouldn't really do anything for an nba player. Additionally, no NBA player has enough muscle to warrant suspicion of anabolics. Sure LeBron and Dwight and Blake Griffin are muscular, but they don't look anything like clay Mathews or any NBA defensive end. The only ped use I could see would be mild dosages of anabolic agents like clenbuterol or anavar in order to gain strength without necessarily gaining huge amounts of muscle. These drugs would also improve joint and tendon strength and because no nba player is lifting very heavy weights, the typical risks with these drugs are limited. Another possibility is taking the same drugs that a cyclist would take to improve or maintain endurance. I could see this as much more common than typical anabolics.\n\nLast point.
