Yes, I know AD does way more than that but that's what I want and not what I trust Dante to do. Ideally I would like a backup that could step up for the games AD or Boogie misses. I mean if Boogie rests for a game or gets injured Asik is our backup and if AD goes down we're stuck playing some version of small ball.

Giannis with another great game with 32/9/4/5. He was getting beat up in the fourth with some no calls but oh well. He only shot 8 FTs this game while shooting at least 15 times in the paint. Snell is a lot more important that people give him credit for. Snell is a way better offensive player than Gary Payton and I would argue his defense is better that the \u201cdefensive specialist\u201d GP2. It sucks because Henson and Giannis had AD and Cousins getting frustrated but Kidd allowed Cousins to get going with Thon in the game. Really irritating loss.

Kidd decided that allowing Gary Payton to 3-9 was good idea and having Liggins in when in need of scoring was smart as well. Brogdon still isn\u2019t doing what he should and isn\u2019t being good enough of the bench. Bledsoe with some absolutely terrible turnovers but also had 5 assists and 4 steals to redeem himself. Thon was nothing but BBQ chicken against Boogie and I don\u2019t understand why Kidd kept him in even when he was scored on 4 straight possessions. \n\nMiddleton had a horrid night shooting 5/19 when we needed his scoring most. Giannis with another great game with 32/9/4/5. He was getting beat up in the fourth with some no calls but oh well. He only shot 8 FTs this game while shooting at least 15 times in the paint. Snell is a lot more important that people give him credit for. Snell is a way better offensive player than Gary Payton and I would argue his defense is better that the \u201cdefensive specialist\u201d GP2. It sucks because Henson and Giannis had AD and Cousins getting frustrated but Kidd allowed Cousins to get going with Thon in the game. Really irritating loss.

We're out 2 starters and 3 bench players right now. \n\nIt's great game experience for the youngsters that will pay off later, and they played well enough to keep us in it. It wasn't mistakes from GP and Vaughn that got us behind. GP played his best game of the season with easy buckets and good defensive pressure. Bledsoe came in and had plenty of time with the starters to pull the game out, it was close until the last 30 seconds. Liggins was playing good D on Nelson who was oddly enough eating Bledsoe up a bit. Liggins also hit a big 3 during the late stretch to keep us in it. \n\nWe did great for how short handed we are and against a great performance from a legitimately good team at home. In the final few minutes we had Giannis miss big free throws, Brogdon missing a floater, Khash miss 2 wide open looks and force another bad one, Henson missing a tried and true shorty hook, and Giannis being a little tooooo unselfish and turning it over on a bad pass... and it was STILL close enough to win. \n\nTough road loss, but nothing bonehead about it.
