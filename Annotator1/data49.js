Their franchise is built around the explosive reigning MVP whose statistical output last year broke the record books. Westbrook\u2019s PPG is down this season which was a given due to the addition of two prolific scorers in George and Anthony.

And where Lebron thrives at taking the right shots at the right time, much less can be said of Russell Westbrook who has historically relied on his pure athleticism over his basketball nous. But let\u2019s not undersell Westbrook\u2019s athletic abilities. There simply has never been a point guard as explosive and as ferocious as Russell Westbrook. His competitiveness drives him and for those reason\u2019s alone Russ need\u2019s the ball in his hands as much as a guy like Lebron needs to orchestrate the offence in Cleveland. \n\nBoth Westbrook and James are elite in their own right. Both Westbrook and James are the face of their franchise. And both Westbrook and James need the ball in their hands. Period.\n\n\nPAUL GEORGE vs. KEVIN LOVE\n\nPaul George has been somewhat of an anomaly so far for the Oklahoma City Thunder. His numbers have fluctuated wildly from game to game as he adjusts to being the secondary scorer in a new system. George has gone from being the face of the Pacers franchise to joining forces with Westbrook at OKC to the surprise of many pundits in the off season. Of course this storyline is very similar to another superstar in Kevin Love, who was very much the face of Minnesota before leaving to team up with Lebron and the Cavs. \n\nKevin Love also had his growing pains in Cleveland in those early days as he carved out a role for himself alongside Kyrie and Lebron. That role eventually led him to an NBA championship and this year Love has been playing some of the most consistent basketball since his T-Wolves days. \n\nPaul George is an elite on the ball defender and scorer and can make an impact on the court with or without the ball being in his hands. He should be able to co-exist with Westbrook and thrive in an environment where he\u2019s not necessarily the face of the franchise. A lot can be said of the pressures associated with being the man, just ask Kevin Durant.\n\nPaul George needs to discover his role alongside Westbrook similar to the way in which Kevin Love found his playing alongside Lebron.\n\n\nCARMELLO ANTHONY vs. DWAYNE WADE\n\nCarmello Anthony needs to take a good, hard look at himself and realise that in the later stages of his somewhat illustrious career, he is no longer the superstar he once was. When asked through the media whether coming off the bench was an option for him, Carmello simply laughed at the notion but father time is no joke. And father time creeps up on the least expectant. And the sooner one can acknowledge that you are past your prime, the sooner one can niche\u2019 out a role suitable to your abilities on the basketball court. \n\nIn contrast, Dwayne Wade, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stands head and shoulders above that of Carmello Anthony\u2019s, quickly came to the realisation that at his age and stage of career, his abilities would be better served coming off the bench for the Cavaliers. And through that process Dwayne Wade\u2019s production has lifted. There is also a deep appreciation from the fan\u2019s perspective in acknowledging the humble yet vital role a weathered superstar like Wade can play on any given team.\n\nThere is simply no need for a scorer of Anthony\u2019s ability to be on the court at the same time as George and Westbrook. I would sooner see a young talent like Jerami Grant who seems to connect well with Westbrook start in Anthony\u2019s place. \n\nThe only question that Carmello Anthony\u2019s left to ask himself is if not now then when? \n"}, {"id": "dr139ph", "body": "Melo wont let himself go to the bench.

And through that process Dwayne Wade\u2019s production has lifted. There is also a deep appreciation from the fan\u2019s perspective in acknowledging the humble yet vital role a weathered superstar like Wade can play on any given team.\n\nThere is simply no need for a scorer of Anthony\u2019s ability to be on the court at the same time as George and Westbrook.

Their franchise is built around the explosive reigning MVP whose statistical output last year broke the record books. Westbrook\u2019s PPG is down this season which was a given due to the addition of two prolific scorers in George and Anthony.

And where Lebron thrives at taking the right shots at the right time, much less can be said of Russell Westbrook who has historically relied on his pure athleticism over his basketball nous. But let\u2019s not undersell Westbrook\u2019s athletic abilities. There simply has never been a point guard as explosive and as ferocious as Russell Westbrook. His competitiveness drives him and for those reason\u2019s alone Russ need\u2019s the ball in his hands as much as a guy like Lebron needs to orchestrate the offence in Cleveland. \n\nBoth Westbrook and James are elite in their own right. Both Westbrook and James are the face of their franchise. And both Westbrook and James need the ball in their hands. Period.\n\n\nPAUL GEORGE vs. KEVIN LOVE\n\nPaul George has been somewhat of an anomaly so far for the Oklahoma City Thunder. His numbers have fluctuated wildly from game to game as he adjusts to being the secondary scorer in a new system. George has gone from being the face of the Pacers franchise to joining forces with Westbrook at OKC to the surprise of many pundits in the off season. Of course this storyline is very similar to another superstar in Kevin Love, who was very much the face of Minnesota before leaving to team up with Lebron and the Cavs. \n\nKevin Love also had his growing pains in Cleveland in those early days as he carved out a role for himself alongside Kyrie and Lebron. That role eventually led him to an NBA championship and this year Love has been playing some of the most consistent basketball since his T-Wolves days. \n\nPaul George is an elite on the ball defender and scorer and can make an impact on the court with or without the ball being in his hands.
