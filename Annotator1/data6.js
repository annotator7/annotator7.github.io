His 15 rebounds per 36 blows his previous career-high of 11.8 out of the water, and actually blows most other bigs in the league out of the water as well. Among qualified players, Len is only behind Hassan Whiteside, DeAndre Jordan, Andre Drummond and Clint Capela in rebounds per 36. \n\nHis offense is definitely improving under Jay Triano as well. Under Earl Watson, the Suns offense was almost always initiated by a predictable high screen pick-and-roll from either Chandler or Len. But under Triano, the team is experimenting with many more sets placing the bigs in position of playmaker on the elbow, trying to find cutters and driving angles for the guards on a team that no longer has ISO options like Bledsoe or Booker (for the time being). \n\nThis has resulted in 2 major changes to Len's game:\n\n1) He's finding other players in a position to score as of late. He currently has 4 straight games of 3+ assists off the bench, which as a big only playing 20-25 minutes is great progress\n\n2) He's simplified his offensive game and is no longer forcing himself to be what he isn't (a pick-and-roll finisher). As a result we've seen his TS% skyrocket from 55% to close to 61%, putting him in the same range as guys like Whiteside, Jokic, Towns and Embiid. \n\nOverall, Len is going to be a very interesting free agent to watch this summer in my opinion. While he is never going to be an above-average scoring option and will continue to get most of his points on easy finishes and putbacks, he is an underrated option for teams to keep an eye on as a player that deserves starting-caliber minutes for his rebounding and defense. \n "}, {"id": "drhf0hw", "body": "he might not be a bust anymore, but he's still a bust"}, {"id": "drhf0hw", "body": "he might not be a bust anymore, but he's still a bust"}, {"id": "drhf6tr", "body": "He still has a terrible career arc for a 5th overall pick but look at the rest of the top 10 in that draft class.
