His endorsement deals could be impacted if he is personally associated to an incident in which one of his social media critics was physically assaulted. Those endorsement deals likely contain \u201cmorals clauses,\u201d which allow the endorsed company to exit a deal if the player is implicated in a legal controversy. Although Harden reaching an out-of-court settlement would probably not worry his endorsed companies, they would nonetheless monitor how the public and media react to it.\n\n&gt;At the same time, Harden may want to avoid a trial. The Rockets and NBA would likely agree. Such a trial could be televised and would no doubt be newsworthy to NBA media and fans\u2014especially in early August when it wouldn\u2019t compete against NBA games and when basketball fans are hungry for news.\n\n&gt;Even if Harden is vindicated at the end of a trial, the trial itself might make for unwanted moments.
