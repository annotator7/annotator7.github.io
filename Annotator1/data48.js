I loved the idea of them too together.  Dunn is a defensive difference-maker.  They'll be great together.  \n\nI mean he obviously wanted Butler more and Lavine is great and everything and an amazing shooter and he'll probably develop into a player with a Butler-like offensive impact, basically what I'm trying to say is it wasn't a bad trade for the Wolves however they decided to make it.  \n\nI was just so surprised when the Bulls were absolutely getting trashed.  Lavine is an amazing prospect to get, Dunn at worst had a rotation spot as a guy who could guard 1-3 and be a \"Tony Allen\" type rotation piece, and moving up 9 shots in a stacked draft and getting a 7 foot guy that can shoot like Markannen in today's NBA?  At worst he's a better Chandler Frye or Ryan Anderson type...not a bad trade for the Bulls at all.  \n\nThibs loves Wiggins who could become what Butler is now, there offensive games and where Wiggins offensive game might lead is pretty similiar.  But Wiggins needs volume and touches to score and get to the line and get in rhythms.  That doesn't fit at all with Butler, Towns, Teague, etc.  Right now for the Wolves Wiggins is a spot up shooting floor spacing who slashes sometimes...that's a horrible role for him....that would have been a perfect role for Lavine.  \n\nI doubt as of this offseason Lavine had more value than Wiggins.  Wiggins almost certainly had more value in my opinion with how well he played over the last half of last season and even last season as a whole.\n\nWiggins -- 24/4/2.5 on 46/36/76 and 7 attempts from the line as a 21-22 year old.
