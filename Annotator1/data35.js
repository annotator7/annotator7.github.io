They have to adjust.  Additionally, these are things that defenses usually get away with, and suddenly don't.  Team X likes to crowd the paint a lot, and the execs don't want Team X winning (or, at least, not winning in a blowout) -- \"We need to crack down on defensive three second violations.\"  Also defensive tendencies since teams often have a style of defense (e.g. moving screens) that the team they're playing does not.  For the example of a team that uses moving screens vs. one that does not, if the refs are told not to call the moving screens because those \"aren't technically moving screens\" or something, the team using them gets an advantage that the other style does not.\n\nTherefore, the odds of games are tipped, without players actually being involved, and even in the referees' cases, they're not necessarily knowingly rigging a game, just calling what rules they're being asked to pay attention to by the higher ups.  \n\nNot full-proof rigging, and still exciting, but I think it's used to try and eke extra excitement from big time matchups or to try and extend a series.  \n\nCoincidentally I think you could argue the lax travel calls, carrying, palming, et cetera, is in part allowed so that it's easier to rig a game.  Show the refs some plays that may or may not be travels, tell them, \"call those plays, they were clear travels,\" and boom you've negated the effectiveness of a lot of players.   Think about how rarely a three-second violation is called -- once one is called, it fucks with a defender.\n\nCurious as to other's takes on this.\n\n[edited for typos and clarity]"}, {"id": "drdqtc8", "body": "I agree with this and I also think a lot of this is done to extend series.

Something that I've noticed with Curry is that he is a rhythm player. In the regular season he's able to get into his rhythm because teams can't gameplan for him like they do in the playoffs. In the playoffs when teams can gameplan for him I've seen multiple times where he hasn't gotten into his rhythm and just doesn\u2019t show up. This could be whether they slow the pace down (early 2015 finals before the lineup switch), being really long and athletic (2016 OKC series), or an injury (2016 finals). Even in the regular season game against Curry got a lot of open shots that he couldn\u2019t hit because Boston\u2019s defense was able to get him out of his rhythm. Kyrie\u2019s \u201cGet Buckets\u201d play style isn\u2019t nearly as good as Curry in the regular season because Curry can get much more efficient shots in the regular season. \n\n\nHowever through three playoff runs I\u2019ve never seen Curry completely impose his will on a playoff series despite being arguably one of the top 5 most dominant regular season scorers of all time. Kyrie in my opinion has the potential with Boston to dominate a series. He just scored an efficient 29 points in the finals against Klay Thompson being supported by 2 DPOY caliber players (Durant, Draymond). He did this mainly off of Iso and transition. In Boston where the offensive system will allow him to get way more opportunities to score (pin downs, two man game with Horford etc.) compared to Cleveland which will allow him to be even more dominant in the postseason. \n\n\nKyrie\u2019s play style is also more well balanced than Curry in that he evenly distributes his shot attempts between threes, mid-range, and at the rim shots, along with the fact that he can get to anywhere on the court with his handle and finish with either hand that never gets blocked makes it impossible for the defense to take away everything from his game. Curry on the other hand has a more three point dependent play style. When a defense locks in on his three point attempts he isn\u2019t nearly as dominant in the regular season. If you look at his percentages Curry is a better finisher and mid-range player than Kyrie but that\u2019s because his crazy three point ability opens up his entire game to get easier looks than Kyrie. Once an elite defensive team takes away his touches from the three point line he isn\u2019t nearly as effective scoring in other areas. To conclude despite my argument it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Kyrie is better than Curry, it just means that I would take Kyrie\u2019s playstyle in the postseason over Curry\u2019s despite some of Curry\u2019s other advantages (spacing, better rebounder etc.) and with that being said I\u2019m ready to get downvoted to hell lol."}, {"id": "drdwjqu", "body": "I would take Kyrie over Curry in a seven game series.
