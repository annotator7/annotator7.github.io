Below is that information from three weeks ago with an update for today ([source for update](http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm/_/sort/RPM)), biggest improvements are in bold:\n\n**James 3.35 / 5.62** (The number one reason for the winning streak is, of course, James, who is making a case for MVP, [second only to James Harden](https://www.basketball-reference.com/friv/mvp.html).)\n\nLove 2.98 / 1.89 (Significantly worse than three weeks ago, Love's RPM suggests he is not the reason for the winning streak.)\n\nFrye 1.17 / 1.30 (Pretty much steady.)\n\n**Korver 0.84 / 2.85** (36-year-old Kyle Korver is showing a remarkable resurgence.  Last year his RPM was -2.76.  As with Green, Cavs fans are hoping he keeps it up.)\n\nGreen 0.78 / 0.25 (This is not a huge improvement but it's remarkable that Green has held pretty steady considering that last year his RPM was -3.34.  While Cavs fans are hoping Crowder returns to last year's form, they are hoping Green does not.)\n\nZizic 0.20 / -0.97 (Plays very few minutes.)\n\nCrowder -1.02 / -2.54 (Crowder's RPM has actually worsened significantly during the winning streak, which is strange because last year Crowder's RPM was 3.89.  If he ever gets it going this team could be *much* better.)\n\nShumpert -1.47 / -1.59 (Shumpert's RPM has not improved.)\n\nCalderon -1.98 / -1.55 (Slight improvement, but, more importantly, 36-year-old Calderon is playing better than 29-year-old Derrick Rose was.)\n\nOsman -1.98 / -1.54 (Slight improvement.)\n\n**Wade -2.81 / -0.14** (Huge improvement as Wade thrives coming off the bench as the back up point guard.)\n\nThompson -2.85 / -2.48 (Thompson last played on November 1, more than three weeks ago, so I'm not sure why his RPM edged up, but as with Rose his absence did not hurt the Cavs and may have helped.)\n\n**Smith -3.07 / -1.19**  (Still not great but nevertheless a significant improvement.)\n\nRose -3.37 / -3.66 (Rose missed most of the last three weeks due to an ankle injury and personal issues.  Judging by RPM, this did not hurt the Cavs at all, and may have helped them.)\n\nJohn Holland was not listed three weeks ago and has a\n-1.71 RPM today, but has played a grand total of 17 minutes all season.\n\nOne more thing, Isaiah Thomas is making steady progress and [is now expected back in mid-December, ahead of schedule.](http://www.nba.com/article/2017/11/28/report-cleveland-cavaliers-target-mid-december-isaiah-thomas-return#/)  Last year Thomas's RPM was 1.83: 5.72 on offense but -3.89 on defense.  Even with his subpar defense, there's no question he can play better than Calderon or Rose when healthy.  \n\n**Edit:** [Wade has said he would prefer to continue coming off the bench when Thomas returns.](http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2017/12/dwyane_wade_does_not_want_to_r.html)  This may not leave much playing time for Calderon or Rose, but that may not be a bad thing for the Cavs, who seem better off with a PG rotation of Thomas and Wade.\n\n**Edit 2:** Don't get me wrong, Kevin Love is still better than Dwyane Wade or J.R.
