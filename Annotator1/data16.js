Drummond is probably gonna have an easy 20/20 game on us the way he's playing these days. Tonight is the last night of a 6 game road trip, I could see a loss to a Pistons team that needs a win.\n\nDetroit beat us at home, I feel like the Dubs have this one marked on their calendar, KD especially. He had a tremendous game against the Hornets, time to confirm against the Pistons, eventhough they just lost 4 in a row. McGee &amp; Shaun in the starting line-up\n\nSome thoughts on the game :\n\n* First possession and I can already tell this is gonna be a nightmare in the paint. McGee's defense was weird, he defended Drummond at the 3 point line then gave him an open lane.\n\n* We're giving Reggie way too much space early on, he's getting everything he wants. Offense is switching between KD in transition and Draymond feeding Klay when he cuts. Also, that McGee possession was downright terrible, he shouldn't touch the ball except to finish an alley-oop\n\n* 6:20 before attempting any 3 pointer, that must be our record this season. That Draymond Shot/Pass was so bad it actually worked, that was hilarious. Horrendous play in transition that ends with a desperate three, that has to be demoralizing.\n\n* Jordan Bell is so impressive, his timing on everything is very good, that block on Tobias was picture perfect. This game has no real flow, everything feels forced, or is it just me ? 3 isn't falling for us, we didn't really have a wide open one, Pistons defending pretty well.\n\n* 30-24, the end of the quarter was pretty surreal, first a silly 3 point foul by Kennard, then a called goaltend that wasn't one, and Cook with the bank shot from his own 3 point line after the buzzer. 6 blocks in the quarter.\n\n* Sloppy plays to start the 2nd, we're not finding any rythm except for West whith his elbow jumper. I legit forgot Boban existed, he's so huge he makes West look like a dwarf.\n\n* Cook is less hesitant tonight, maybe the starting role the other day was getting him nervous. We can't make a three tonight 1-9. The Pistons are really tough defensively.\n\n* Kevon Looney is in, gonna stop that scrub Drummond. On a more serious note, Klay having Batum &amp; Bradley back to back is really tough, they're always in his short at foul limit, he doesn't have an inch of space.\n\n* 46-50, tough first half, Jackson had a really good half, he ends it with a silky smooth 3. We're relying way too much on ISO, we can't get any ball movement going, props to the Pistons defense for that, they're everywhere. Also, Dubs can't get in much rythm when the three isn't falling.\n\n* It's early in the second half, but you can see defense has improved, they're not letting anyone get free easily, Drummond isn't getting in the paint, McGee bothered him on back to back possession with a nice block.\n\n* KD getting the offensive board while barely standing and making the jumper was crazy. Little things going our way. KD is such a sneaky scorer, just checked, thought he was at like 16 or something, when he's already at 24. Such a smooth game.\n\n* This game shows you the importance of a good crowd for the viewing experience. Pistons are having a great game against the defending champ and the place is a fucking library, it just hurts the game as a whole.\n\n* Klay finally hits a three, the streak lives on. Drummond has become an excellent passer, he oftens find the cutter at the right time. The Pistons offense is becoming more and more static with each possession.\n\n* Are we so focused on defending the paint that we became mediocre at defeneding the three ? Don't have the stats but it feels like we're letting teams shoot more than 15 open threes a game.\n\n* 77-67, Dubs end the 3rd with a perfect possession, that was some nice ball movement finished by a Cook 3 pointer. Bell has something special in him. Drummond has been shut down most of the game (still 15 rebounds), we can't let him take confidence in the 4th.\n\n* West v Boban part 2, such a weird match-up. Casspi tried to contest that dunk, he has my respect for that, that must be a scary thing to behold.\n\n* Klay is really off this game, he even forgot to defend that last play, if that Tolliver 3 went in, it was on him, that would've been a good momentum for the Pistons. That said, Bradley spent all game chasing him around without letting him an inch of space, I can understand the frustration.\n\n* Dish Smith is such a great spark coming off the bench, he's lightning quick, such a good back-up for Jackson, he brings the playmaking that Jackson doesn't have.\n\n* Warriors are having a block party for the last two games, 13 (?) against the Hornets and 13 here tonight for now. They didn't only block in the paint, there were multiple block on jump shots, I'm impressed by this team's ability to perfectly time their blocks\n\n* Klay is such an amazing shooter, the few times he gets space, his realease is so goddamn quick that Bradley can't recover and he sinks the 3 in his face.\n\n* Can any other player in the league affect a game so much by only scoring 2 points, Draymond's statline are such an anomaly for someone that has this kind of impact.\n\n* KD with the MONSTER block on Tolliver. 34/10/7/5 with only 1 TO for KD, he's been great these last two games. This was probably an even better game than against the Hornets.\n\n* Avery Bradley is a stone cold killer, KD tried to dribble out of the double team and lost the ball in the worst possible place. Pistons are not letting this one go, they need a win.\n\n* Pistons had the opprtunity to win and Jackson totally blew it, that was such an horrendous play, He threw the game. Klay hit both FTs, game is nearly done.\n\nOverall, it was a tough, sluggish, grindish kind of game and I'm glad it is over, we end the road trip with a 6-0 record but not without casualty. KD's been amazing without Steph. Pistons defense was really bothering us. GG Pistons bro, see you next year.\n\nNext game is at home against the Blazers, always an entertaining one. We have 9 out of the next 12 game at home including a 7 in a row.\n\nGood night everyone"}, {"id": "dqzbfiv", "body": "Still no Steph, no Zaza either tonight (shoulder). Drummond is probably gonna have an easy 20/20 game on us the way he's playing these days. Tonight is the last night of a 6 game road trip, I could see a loss to a Pistons team that needs a win.\n\nDetroit beat us at home, I feel like the Dubs have this one marked on their calendar, KD especially. He had a tremendous game against the Hornets, time to confirm against the Pistons, eventhough they just lost 4 in a row. McGee &amp; Shaun in the starting line-up\n\nSome thoughts on the game :\n\n* First possession and I can already tell this is gonna be a nightmare in the paint. McGee's defense was weird, he defended Drummond at the 3 point line then gave him an open lane.\n\n* We're giving Reggie way too much space early on, he's getting everything he wants. Offense is switching between KD in transition and Draymond feeding Klay when he cuts. Also, that McGee possession was downright terrible, he shouldn't touch the ball except to finish an alley-oop\n\n* 6:20 before attempting any 3 pointer, that must be our record this season.

Basically, the private nature of the hotel room that this occurred made it impossible to get a full picture of what happened unless she testifies. Would justice have been served either way if she did? That, we'll never know. \n\n\nWas Ms. Faber's treatment by the media shameful? Absolutely. That's due completely to Kobe's fame. Kobe exists in this weird gray area where he both did and didn't commit rape, mainly because both sides settled it as a civil trial, the terms of which are somewhat unclear. Under the strict definition of the law, Kobe did not commit rape, but the court of public opinion sees otherwise. It really comes down to which you personally think is more important.

He can't do either of those things good enough to overlook all the bad.
