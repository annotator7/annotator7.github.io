Would\u2019ve been forced to buy in from cp3 and harden, it simply wouldn\u2019t be possible for him to isolate. The only question is whether melo being a spot up shooter is truly that much of an upgrade over Anderson. And you could argue that another scorer is fine, give cp3/harden a break, but you have Gordon as a shot creator too and even he isn\u2019t much of a downgrade if at all over melo\n\nEssentially my point is I don\u2019t think melo would have really pushed the needle that much. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d hold them back either. Melo would have a lot more success though "}, {"id": "drdtzer", "body": "To me Melo and Anderson comparison falls down to this. Melo is definitively a worse pure shooter than Anderson even ignoring this season's decline. Anderson has longer range and quicker release against closing defenders. If the idea is we only want Olympic Melo as a spot up shooter, then this is actually a downgrade. The whole offseason argument for Olympic Melo was really quite off. His strength isn't pure shooting. If it was he wouldn't have needed the closer FIBA 3pt line to be a great 3pt shooter. Ryan Anderson, for all his warts, has always been one of the best pure 3pt shooters.\n\nHowever, the issue with Anderson last year's playoffs was that if he can't do anything else on offense (while being a sieve on defense) and Harden was forced to always create. And even Harden gets tired if he has to do everything. Melo theoretically would be able to add another dimension to the Rockets attack and be able to help Harden rest more while leading the bench units. So before the season I definitely wanted to do the trade because I felt at worst Melo would  be a slight upgrade and possibly more.\n\nBasically at this point in the season Melo has performed much worse than I thought while Anderson has performed a lot better. Anderson has lowkeyed improved both his shooting and his defense from last year. So the combination makes this in retrospect a good non-trade even if we attribute some of Melo's decline to Russ."}, {"id": "drdtzer", "body": "To me Melo and Anderson comparison falls down to this.
