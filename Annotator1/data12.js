That'll probably change as he plays more games/minutes but that's my team right now. \n\nDraymond is an All Star caliber player but the Warriors got 4 All Stars because they were by far the best team in the league and destroying teams routinely. This year they're at 19-6, which is \"only\" the 3rd best record in the league. I don't think their regular season performance warrants 4 selections this year. Teams rarely ever get 4 All Stars in, the Warriors of the past couple years and the Hawks a few years before that (due to an injury replacement) were on pace for record-setting regular seasons. \n\nEdit: Fuck it, I should probably consider a Jazz player as well but I'm not sure who..."}, {"id": "dqshiw6", "body": "No jazz player deserves it now, McCollum or Booker or Gasol over Klay too imo"}, {"id": "dqshiw6", "body": "No jazz player deserves it now, McCollum or Booker or Gasol over Klay too imo"}, {"id": "dqsi88i", "body": "Klay is playing phenomenal. 20 ppg on 50/40/90 and elite defense.
