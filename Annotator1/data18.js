But, far too many people came out of the 76ers organization with a story of how Larry wouldn't let anyone shoot unless there was like five seconds on the clock.\n\nBy design, you have turned your star into a chucker and ballhog to anyone that isn't in the huddle. They also made a concerted effort to surround Allen with guys that \"only\" wanted to play defense.\n\nWith OKC, I feel like they are trying to build a more balanced team, but not necessarily a more balanced offense. Previously, it was Kevin and Russ, \"shoot the ball, make the shots, we'll be over here.\"\n\nAnd, now, it's much of the same, \"Russ, Carmelo and Paul just shoot the ball, we'll sit back and count the wins!\" It was so painfully clear early in the season that they really thought it was a matter of rolling a ball out on the floor. That didn't work.\n\nThen, we sat through Russell taking ten steps back in an effort to get Paul and Carmelo going, but that really didn't work. Now, Carmelo is stepping back and it's still not working. Paul has done the same in a few games, it didn't work. He's come out more aggressive in a few games, it didn't work.\n\nThe only times they've looked like they are supposed to was against GS and late going during some of these incredibly ugly games. The factor in both situations? They aren't worried about getting someone going, they are worried about winning. That's it.\n\nThey wanted to destroy GS, that was the focus, not following a ten bullet point list of what they should be \"fundamentally\" doing. These past few games that they shouldn't have won, they stopped focusing on who would shoot, they just threw up shots and if one kept making them, they got to keep shooting.\n\nAs to how that plays into the stats, good or bad, these guys are just doing whatever they believe it takes. For Russell, it has turned into a scarlet triple double, but he's seen what laying back does and he's seen what \"hero ball\" can do and he's going for the win.\n\nWhen it works, it's \"finally, that's what we're looking for\". When it doesn't it's a front page of \"Russell sucks!\" Not much in between and very little context. A lot of people won't even admit that they only saw a box score until actually pressed.\n\nPersonally, I can't really fault a guy that loses because he's trying to win.

They're just overthinking all of it right now, because no one wants to be the blame, even though they are all willing to shoulder the burden."}, {"id": "dr10rfg", "body": "Maybe as an Allen Iverson fan for so many years, I am just not fazed by Russell, but I kind of see a lot of similarities in the two and how they are used by their coaching staff.\n\nIt can absolutely be argued that they don't listen to coaches, that's fine if that's the angle you want to take. But, far too many people came out of the 76ers organization with a story of how Larry wouldn't let anyone shoot unless there was like five seconds on the clock.\n\nBy design, you have turned your star into a chucker and ballhog to anyone that isn't in the huddle. They also made a concerted effort to surround Allen with guys that \"only\" wanted to play defense.\n\nWith OKC, I feel like they are trying to build a more balanced team, but not necessarily a more balanced offense. Previously, it was Kevin and Russ, \"shoot the ball, make the shots, we'll be over here.\"\n\nAnd, now, it's much of the same, \"Russ, Carmelo and Paul just shoot the ball, we'll sit back and count the wins!\" It was so painfully clear early in the season that they really thought it was a matter of rolling a ball out on the floor. That didn't work.\n\nThen, we sat through Russell taking ten steps back in an effort to get Paul and Carmelo going, but that really didn't work. Now, Carmelo is stepping back and it's still not working. Paul has done the same in a few games, it didn't work. He's come out more aggressive in a few games, it didn't work.\n\nThe only times they've looked like they are supposed to was against GS and late going during some of these incredibly ugly games. The factor in both situations? They aren't worried about getting someone going, they are worried about winning. That's it.\n\nThey wanted to destroy GS, that was the focus, not following a ten bullet point list of what they should be \"fundamentally\" doing. These past few games that they shouldn't have won, they stopped focusing on who would shoot, they just threw up shots and if one kept making them, they got to keep shooting.\n\nAs to how that plays into the stats, good or bad, these guys are just doing whatever they believe it takes. For Russell, it has turned into a scarlet triple double, but he's seen what laying back does and he's seen what \"hero ball\" can do and he's going for the win.\n\nWhen it works, it's \"finally, that's what we're looking for\".

And with Parker on the bench I think our bench becomes better than theirs.\n\n\nIt's a 13 man rotation for the Spurs, but we only go 10-11 deep in the playoffs so the loss of depth wouldn't be that huge of a deal. We also probably end up losing more games than we otherwise would have, but we are pretty much locked into the 3rd seed whether we win 52 or 57 games. \n\nThe Spurs probably say no just to not throw away our identity, but I think both teams benefit with this trade. Grizzlies also might say no if they think they can be competitive next year so it might be predicated on Marc Gasol demanding out. Grizzlies may also demand Murray over White which I can't 100% see the Spurs agreeing to. \n\nMills is eligible to be traded on [January 15](https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2017/12/nba-players-who-remain-ineligible-to-be-traded.html).
