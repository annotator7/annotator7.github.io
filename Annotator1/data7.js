This isn't a thing like a 60 point game or a 5x5. This \"40 pts, 90% FG%\" has happened 3 times since 1983 and obviously it hasn't happened in the last 17 years as OP said. You can't make an accurate guess for this because it's just luck based. It's not like Alonzo, Pippen, and Cedric Ceballos (only guys to do it) were special scorers or had a unique skill that you can identify in current players. \n\nWith 60 point games it's easy to make an educated guess about who could possibly do it next. Same with 5x5. This unique stat OP found is way to uncommon to do the same. \n\nAll that said, for this to happen to *someone*, they'd have to get lucky and draw a lot of fouls. If you shoot 20 FTs and make all of them, it becomes much easier to get lucky and go 10/10 or like 10/11 from the field. If you barely get fouled you're gonna be taking a lot of field goals and the more field goals you take, the more chances you have to miss.
