I agree that there are \"degrees\" of 1st vs 2nd tech, where there is more leeway for the 2nd tech and it needs to be a clearly electable offense or escalation of the first one. I don't think that was the case in this play. This has always been an unwritten rule in basketball. I don't think there was a double standard for it being a star player. They don't call this a tech if it's McCaw doing the same thing with already one tech. I know the anti-warriors and KD sentiment is strong here, but I would be disappointed in the league if ANY player got tossed because of that. There was not argument or escalation of confrontation. Calderon didn't even react to KD, instead reacted to the ref just to try and get a tech call. It was borderline a baiting. Also, I do not believe there is a double standard for Draymond and KD as many people like to think. Both have been thrown out for 2nd techs already THIS YEAR, so refs are not afraid to do so should the techs be warranted. Refs in general have been issuing more 2nd tech ejections this year (Lebron got his 1st ever ffs), but I think this got blown out of proportion due to who it is and the reaction from JVG. The first words he said were \"he should be ejected\", but later backed off of it after seeing the replay, I believe."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7n2xdb", "body": "Really curious to see everyones thoughts on this topic.
