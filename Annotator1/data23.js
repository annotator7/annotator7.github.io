Tristan Thompson is the biggest example of this, but people like Ian Mahinmi also have large contracts, and are, in some people's eyes, not putting up the stats expected of them. With this in mind, I wanted to create a stat that would give a more objective look at whether or not a player is putting up the stats expected of their contract value. \n\nIf you don't care about how I got the numbers, skip the next section. So anyways...\n\n#The Stat\n\nThe Stat itself is pretty simple: VAC=TV-(C+Contract Value)\n\nTV, or Total Value, is a stat that I made to try to tell how much value a player's box score is providing to their team. It's a pretty big stat, so lets break down that one first. \n\n*TV=(PPGx(1+((TS%x3)-1.665))+(TRB/Gx1.7)+(AST/Gx2.2)+(BLK/Gx6.1)+(STL/Gx9.1)-(TOV/Gx5.4)*\n\n**PPGx(1+((TS%x3)-1.665)** is the point value. Its points per game multiplied by 1 plus the player's true shooting percentage times 3, minus 1.665. 1.665 in this case is the leauge average TS% so far multiplied by 3. What this does is that it rewards a player for getting points efficiently. For example: a player averaging 30 ppg, but only has a 48 TS%, will have a point value of 23.25 because their shooting is far below average. However, a player averaging 20ppg on 65 TS% will have a point value of 25.7. This is because, although they are getting less points, they are much more efficient with their shots, and therefore will usually be better for their team.\n\nThe rest of the stats are just the stats per game multiplied by their predictive ability, which I got from [this article.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hidden-value-of-the-nba-steal/) So for example, an assist is listed as being equivalent to 2.2 points in terms of win predictability, therefore to get a player's assist value, you take their assists per game and multiply it by 2.2. Same with turnovers, although you subtract the final turnover value instead, as turnovers decrease a player's win predictability. \n\nGoing back to the original stat, **C** is a constant. This is gotten by finding the league average Total Value, then subtracting that from the league average contract. For example, so far this year, I found the average player had a line of 10.5/4.3/2.3/ 0.5 BLK and 0.8 STL. This created a Total Value of 24.816. The average league contract so far is $6,517,400, or 6.517 million. 24.816-6.517=18.2986. So we would expect a league average player to provide a Total Value 18.2986 higher than their contract value in millions. The constant sets this to 0, so a league average player would have a VAC of 0.\n\n\nLets walk through an example using ~~Michael Jordan~~ Jaylen Brown. Jaylen has a line of 14.5/5.8/1.2 with 1.7 turnovers, .4 blocks, and 1.1 steals on 56.8 TS%. His Total Value would come out to (14.5x(1+(1.704-1.665)))+(5.8x1.7)+(1.2x2.2)+(0.4x6.1)+(1.1x9.1)-(1.7x5.4), or 30.8355. His contract is $4,956,000, which we change to 4.956. Finally, we subtract his total value by his contract plus the constant, 30.8355-(18.2986+4.956). Jaylen's VAC, therefore, is 7.5809; he is providing 7.5809 more win probability than we would expect someone with his contract to provide. \n\n#The Results\n\nWith this in mind, here's a few more players so you can get an idea of what a good player's (or a bad player's) VAC will usually be.  \n\nName | Total Value | Contract in Millions | Value Above Contract\n:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:\nAverage Player | 24.816 | 6.5174 | 0\nRussell Westbrook | 54.465 | 28.53 | 7.6364\nJames Harden | 62.441 | 28.299 | 15.8434\nLeBron James | 66.3194 | 33.286 | 14.7348\nJaylen Brown | 30.8355 | 4.956 | 7.5809\nTristan Thompson | 15.0629 | 16.4 | -19.6357\nIan Mahinmi | 9.2242 | 16.662 | -25.7364\nShaun Livingston | 13.1792 | 7.692 | -12.8114\nJohn Wall | 41.8776 | 18.064 | 5.515\nSteph Curry | 57.4632 | 34.683 | 4.4816\nKyrie Irving | 50.1609 | 18.869 | 12.9933\n\nAs expected, good players tend to have higher VAC. I was surprised at Steph having such a low VAC compared to others, which I will discuss in the next section. Also, this sample had a standard deviation of around 13.5, so we could measure a \"good\" VAC to be around 10 or higher (although I would like to test more to get a more accurate standard deviation).\n\nAlso, if you want to try your own, I have an outline in Google Spreadsheets [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uic-tY0gVs5PRVhnJPE-JeZCv1hscJIBwMpu_QWV9-Y/edit?usp=sharing) Just copy the spreadsheet and paste it into your own Google Spreadseet (I'm not sure if it works in Excel, if anyone wants to test it that would be cool).\n\n#Notes\n\nThere are several things which you should keep in mind while looking at this stat:\n\n* As with any stat, it doesn't fully account for how much impact a player really has on their team (see: my flair). This might be one of the reason Steph has a lower VAC than other guards such as Kyrie or Wall. Most would agree that Steph is better than those guards, however because of factors that don't show up on the box score (gravity, Kerr taking him out in the fourth, etc.) the box score does not fully show how valuable he is to his team. This leads to my second point...\n\n* VAC is not meant to show how good a player is. It is meant to show if the stats a player is putting up would be expected considering his contract value. If LeBron made $100,000,000 per year, he would still be the best player in the league, but his VAC would tank because he is making so much money.\n\n* The win predictability I used strongly weighted steals and blocks, which are not the best representations of defensive ability.\n\nAny comments/suggestions/etc are welcome.

This leads to my second point...\n\n* VAC is not meant to show how good a player is. It is meant to show if the stats a player is putting up would be expected considering his contract value. If LeBron made $100,000,000 per year, he would still be the best player in the league, but his VAC would tank because he is making so much money.\n\n* The win predictability I used strongly weighted steals and blocks, which are not the best representations of defensive ability.\n\nAny comments/suggestions/etc are welcome.

Tristan Thompson is the biggest example of this, but people like Ian Mahinmi also have large contracts, and are, in some people's eyes, not putting up the stats expected of them. With this in mind, I wanted to create a stat that would give a more objective look at whether or not a player is putting up the stats expected of their contract value. \n\nIf you don't care about how I got the numbers, skip the next section. So anyways...\n\n#The Stat\n\nThe Stat itself is pretty simple: VAC=TV-(C+Contract Value)\n\nTV, or Total Value, is a stat that I made to try to tell how much value a player's box score is providing to their team. It's a pretty big stat, so lets break down that one first. \n\n*TV=(PPGx(1+((TS%x3)-1.665))+(TRB/Gx1.7)+(AST/Gx2.2)+(BLK/Gx6.1)+(STL/Gx9.1)-(TOV/Gx5.4)*\n\n**PPGx(1+((TS%x3)-1.665)** is the point value. Its points per game multiplied by 1 plus the player's true shooting percentage times 3, minus 1.665. 1.665 in this case is the leauge average TS% so far multiplied by 3. What this does is that it rewards a player for getting points efficiently. For example: a player averaging 30 ppg, but only has a 48 TS%, will have a point value of 23.25 because their shooting is far below average. However, a player averaging 20ppg on 65 TS% will have a point value of 25.7. This is because, although they are getting less points, they are much more efficient with their shots, and therefore will usually be better for their team.\n\nThe rest of the stats are just the stats per game multiplied by their predictive ability, which I got from [this article.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-hidden-value-of-the-nba-steal/) So for example, an assist is listed as being equivalent to 2.2 points in terms of win predictability, therefore to get a player's assist value, you take their assists per game and multiply it by 2.2. Same with turnovers, although you subtract the final turnover value instead, as turnovers decrease a player's win predictability. \n\nGoing back to the original stat, **C** is a constant. This is gotten by finding the league average Total Value, then subtracting that from the league average contract. For example, so far this year, I found the average player had a line of 10.5/4.3/2.3/ 0.5 BLK and 0.8 STL. This created a Total Value of 24.816. The average league contract so far is $6,517,400, or 6.517 million. 24.816-6.517=18.2986. So we would expect a league average player to provide a Total Value 18.2986 higher than their contract value in millions. The constant sets this to 0, so a league average player would have a VAC of 0.\n\n\nLets walk through an example using ~~Michael Jordan~~ Jaylen Brown. Jaylen has a line of 14.5/5.8/1.2 with 1.7 turnovers, .4 blocks, and 1.1 steals on 56.8 TS%. His Total Value would come out to (14.5x(1+(1.704-1.665)))+(5.8x1.7)+(1.2x2.2)+(0.4x6.1)+(1.1x9.1)-(1.7x5.4), or 30.8355. His contract is $4,956,000, which we change to 4.956. Finally, we subtract his total value by his contract plus the constant, 30.8355-(18.2986+4.956). Jaylen's VAC, therefore, is 7.5809; he is providing 7.5809 more win probability than we would expect someone with his contract to provide. \n\n#The Results\n\nWith this in mind, here's a few more players so you can get an idea of what a good player's (or a bad player's) VAC will usually be.  \n\nName | Total Value | Contract in Millions | Value Above Contract\n:--: | :--: | :--: | :--:\nAverage Player | 24.816 | 6.5174 | 0\nRussell Westbrook | 54.465 | 28.53 | 7.6364\nJames Harden | 62.441 | 28.299 | 15.8434\nLeBron James | 66.3194 | 33.286 | 14.7348\nJaylen Brown | 30.8355 | 4.956 | 7.5809\nTristan Thompson | 15.0629 | 16.4 | -19.6357\nIan Mahinmi | 9.2242 | 16.662 | -25.7364\nShaun Livingston | 13.1792 | 7.692 | -12.8114\nJohn Wall | 41.8776 | 18.064 | 5.515\nSteph Curry | 57.4632 | 34.683 | 4.4816\nKyrie Irving | 50.1609 | 18.869 | 12.9933\n\nAs expected, good players tend to have higher VAC.
