A lot of that roster is full of no-names/bad defenders (I mean, Parker gets crunch-time minutes) and while Aldridge's interior defense is good, San Antonio has won a lot of games because Green is one of the few perimeter defenders who can really guard the paint (as well as provide elite perimeter defense). \n\nPaul George &lt;-- potential DPOY.

Just incredible to watch him every night epitomize (at the highest level) what elite defense means in the new, switch-heavy NBA.

While Embiid's defensive presence helps a lot, Simmons is their most consistent, most available, and most effective player, as someone who uses his length to provide outstanding perimeter defense for a young roster. \n\nKevin Durant &lt;-- the truth is he's always been an elite defender, but now more of the NBA media is taking notice. Those OKC teams always made deep playoffs runs due to their elite defense anchored by Durant and Adams, and now in Golden State, Durant is a two-way monster, playing part rim protector, part chasedown blocker, part lockdown perimeter guy. Golden State does the switch heavy fad better than anyone else in the league, and while having Draymond, Thompson and Iguodala always made that a possibility, Durant really shows why playing that scheme (with the right personnel) makes a team nearly unstoppable defensively.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo&lt;-- The Bucks are not a good defensive team, but I don't think any player is a better one-on-one defender than Giannis. He doesn't have great fundamentals, but his length and speed basically make him an impossible matchup for any opposing player, whether it's a big man or a point guard. \n\nAndre Drummond &lt;-- I debated this one a lot, with Davis, Horford, and Gobert all making good cases, but Drummond's elevated his play a lot from the past few years.

Hell coaches are just now realizing the importance of advanced stats and analytics and how much it can impact the game.\n\nIt's just amazing to see how quickly and fiercely people will act to preserve a player's image.\n\nWhat really blows my mind is the idea that dipo had 2 seasons in the NBA, was 23, and supposedly had \"peaked\" because his third season wasn't amazing even though it was injury plagued, and his 4th was with okc where he was never really allowed to develop within the offense.\n\nYes, he worked hard in the off-season. He improved a lot. More than expected even. But that's what young players do - when given the opportunity.
