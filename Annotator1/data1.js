He commands defensive attention, especially inside, and he is smoothing out his shot from beyond 10 feet. If he continues progressing this quickly, the dude will be a force by his mid 20s.\n\nLonzo Ball is a legit player. He defends incredibly and his BBIQ is through the roof. The kid reads plays super well and he seems to have a sense of where the ball is going at all times. He seems to be at the right place most of the time and doesn't look as confused as most rookies. That being said, his shot is still broke and he needs to fix his handles/finishing at the rim. \n\nEdit: Lonzo does not cut nearly as much as I'd hope and his off-ball movement needs work, but the kid is good overall. Also his half-court passing is not nearly as impressive as his transition passing, but I'm pretty sure that's just to keep from turning the ball over.\n\nRandle is turning into the player everyone expected him to be. Strong, intimidating, and athletic. His body transformation was no joke as he tends to fly around whenever he's on the court (low minutes obviously helps). He looks less lost than before, but he also hardly ever gets tired. His shot is still booty, but he is such a force inside it doesn't matter at times. If he improved his fouling and shooting, that'd be awesome.\n\nKuzma is a fucking stud. Straight up. He lacks defensive skills, but the kid can straight up score. His reaction time and decision making is awesome for a rookie and the game looks too fast for him only on the defensive end. His shooting is incredibly improved since college, and the kid just has incredible balance and footwork. With his mamba mentality, I can see him becoming a perennial all-star in this league.\n\nNance looks like the player he's been and is going to be. Solid defensively, decent rebounder and put back guy, but absolutely useless outside of layup/dunking range.\n\nHart is decent and filling in well. He might be a solid journeyman when all is said and done. Don't see him enough to have any real insight.

Fast, plays great defense and has decent offense when being fed the ball.

Really good at stealing the ball and reading the offense which makes him a really good defender as well. Honestly hope he's our future point guard because all he really needs to do is get good at shooting and he'll be amazing. Really helps that him and Poeltl played together so their chemistry was already great.\n* **Pascal Siakam** - This guy has two main problems. He runs too fast. Weird problem to have but it's true. This generally leads to missing wide open layups because he can't slow down in time and lacks the control to make the layup while moving fast. The other being shooting. He had a stint where he would make a 3 every once in a while but I think there was a stat that showed he was 0-23 from 3 for the month of December or something. Crazy shit. If he can get his shooting and control under the basket in motion under control he's amazing. Great defender with amazing fast break threat. \n* **OG Anunoby** - Our God has been everything promised and more. I look forward to years and years of OG. Right now his biggest issue is his ball handling, mostly off the dribble. He had a really good assist to turnover ratio for a while but then he started to dribble much more often while moving and would get stripped so easily. It's pretty ugly unless he's driving with the conviction to dunk or something. He's just gotta work on that.\n* Now onto the guys who aren't on rookie contracts but are still are pretty young.\n* **Norman Powell** - There's no other way to go about it, Norman has been terrible this year. He underperformed up until his injury. Then he came back and seemed back to normal for 2 games then fell right back off a cliff. He has almost no BBIQ it seems as he blindly drives into multiple defenders with no play thinking he is Westbrook or something rather when he should be driving and kicking it out to somebody out behind the arc. It's been a consistent frustration watching Powell play as of late. Out of everyone on our team he has had the most trouble adapting to the new offense. Hopefully he finds his way in it soon.\n* **Fred Van Vleet** - Started the season on a low note. Similar issues to Norman where he would drive blindly in and get stripped or try to go in for a layup as a 6ft tall guy against multiple players much taller than him and get blocked. He did have his moments of greatness though where he would bring energy into the offense when we were playing slow and lazy. Then Delon went down and everyone was scared of Fred getting all those minutes. Then Fred went super saiyan and became one of the best bench players we have and was even good for the occasional 3. \n* All in all, it's looking good in Toronto."}, {"id": "drqj8l2", "body": "* **Jakob Poeltl** - Looks to be a starting center come next year.
