He does just enough to score by this I mean it's not flashy. Just look at his 60 point game. A lot of his points was playing the game fundamentally and letting the shots come to him. Catch and shoot, playing the passing lanes, and pump fake into an easy lay up.  \n\nSame with his defense. He won't get crazy blocks or strips all the time but he'll stay in front of you with his hand in your face play after play while going through screens and picks.

Well, passing seems to be one of the most subjective categories to rank people by; if you look up any point guards highlight reel, you'll see amazing passes that we think only that person can make.

But to differentiate the two, I look at it like this: CP3 is more effective with his passing, but can be flashy. Rondo is more flashy, but can be effective. I think both have a claim, along with Nash, to be the best passer of this generation though. That being said, if I had to choose who I'd prefer, give me Rondo.
