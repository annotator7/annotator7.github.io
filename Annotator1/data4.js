Even then, Brown only coached New York for one season in 2005/06. \n\nOut of 31 seasons as an ABA/NBA coach, including partial seasons, Larry Brown's teams \n\n- had winning records under him for 24 seasons\n- had losing records under him for 6 seasons\n- had 1 season exactly at 0.500\n\nLarry Brown coached a record 8 different NBA franchises to the NBA Playoffs and coached 2 different ABA franchises to the ABA Playoffs. However, this also led to Brown's negative reputation for quickly and suddenly departing from one team to another.\n\nBrown is also the only head coach to win both an NCAA (1988) and NBA title (2004).\n\n###**Carolina Cougars (ABA)**\n\n- 1972 - 35-49 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1973 - 57-27 - Lost EDF 4-3 (equivalent to ECF)\n- 1974 - 47-37 - Lost EDSF 4-0 (equivalent to ECSF)\n\nAfter Larry Brown's departure, the Carolina Cougars would become the Spirits of St. Louis and finished 32-52 and 35-49 in the 1975 and 1976 seasons, respectively. They did make the 1975 EDF even with a poor record, however.\n\n###**Denver Nuggets (ABA)**\n\n- 1974 - 37-47 - Lost 1st Round Tiebreaker 1-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1975 - 65-19 - Lost WDF 4-3 (equivalent to WCF)\n- 1976 - 60-24 - Lost ABA Finals 4-2\n\n###**Denver Nuggets (NBA)**\n\n- 1977 - 50-32 - Lost WCSF 4-2\n- 1978 - 48-34 - Lost WCF 4-2\n- 1979 - 28-25 - Under Brown for 53 games - Lost 1st Round 2-1\n\nAfter Brown [resigned midseason](http://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/larry-brown-in-the-ucla-pressure-cooker.html) to coach UCLA, the 1979 Nuggets went 19-10 under Donnie Walsh to finish the year 47-35. The Lakers would beat Denver 2-1 in the 1st Round. \n\nAfterwards, the Nuggets missed the 1980 and 1981 Playoffs with 30-52 and 37-45 records, respectively. Doug Moe would coach the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 1982-1990 including a 1985 WCF appearance. \n\nThe only two years in which the Nuggets' franchise player, David Thompson, won a playoff series were under Larry Brown in 1976 and 1978.\n\nBrown would coach UCLA to the 1980 NCAA Title Game, but they lost to Louisville 59-54 and later had their appearance vacated due to two players being found ineligible. Brown would then coach the New Jersey Nets in the upcoming season.\n\n###**New Jersey Nets**\n\n- 1981 - 24-58 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1982 - 44-38 - Lost 1st Round 2-0\n- 1983 - 47-29 - Under Brown for 76 games - Lost 1st Round 2-0\n\nBrown [resigned near the end of the season](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/08/sports/brown-resigns-as-nets-coach-to-take-job-at-kansas.html) to coach Kansas. Kansas would win the 1988 NCAA Title under Brown despite being a 6-seed and finishing the year at 27-11, the most losses for an NCAA Champion. \n\nThe Nets went 2-4 under Bill Blair to end the 1983 season and were swept in the 1st Round 2-0 by the Knicks. After Brown's departure, the Nets would lose in the 1984 ECSF, followed by two 1st Round exits.\n\nLarry Brown [left Kansas](http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-14/sports/sp-4299_1_san-antonio) after winning the NCAA title to coach the Spurs. After his departure, Kansas was banned from the 1989 NCAA Tournament due to recruiting violations. This is the only time a reigning NCAA Champion was banned from the tournament.\n\nAlthough this did not involve any of Brown's players, Brown and others [had given money](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-brown-skips-town-again.html) to a potential recruit in Vincent Askew. Brown claimed that Askew needed it for a plane trip to visit his ill grandmother, but Askew used it to pay for an aunt's phone bill in addition to a plane ticket.\n\n###**San Antonio Spurs**\n\n- 1988 - 31-51 - Lost 1st Round 3-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1989 - 21-61 - Missed playoffs \n- 1990 - 56-26 - Lost WCSF 4-3\n - The 1990 Spurs underwent a massive roster overhaul with the additions of Terry Cummings, Rod Strickland, and rookies David Robinson and Sean Elliott.

The Spurs would go 26-18 under Bob Bass to finish the year at 47-35 and were swept 3-0 in the 1st Round of the 1992 Playoffs by the Suns.\n\nThe Spurs would still find success after Brown's departure, making the playoffs every year afterwards, with the exception of David Robinson's injury season in 1997.\n\nGregg Popovich first became involved in NBA coaching [as an assistant under Larry Brown](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/larry-brown-cut-gregg-popovich-twice-still-proud-231940689--nba.html) in the 1988/89 season with the Spurs. Earlier, Brown had cut Popovich during tryouts for the Nuggets when Brown was still coaching in Denver. \n\nPopovich would later become a volunteer assistant under Larry Brown with Kansas from 1986-1987. When Brown left Kansas to coach the Spurs, he offered Popovich to join him as an assistant coach in San Antonio.\n\nGregg Popovich has credited Larry Brown for helping to develop him as a coach. Just before Brown and Popovich's respective teams faced off in the 2005 Finals, [Popovich stated](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/best-friends-brown-and-popovich-foes-in-nba-finals/) \u201cWithout him, I wouldn\u2019t be here, so it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\n###**Los Angeles Clippers**\n\n- 1991 - 31-51 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1992 - 23-12 - Under Brown for 35 games - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n - The 1992 Clippers were 22-25 prior to Brown's midseason arrival and finished the season 45-37\n- 1993 - 41-41 - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n\nBrown [resigned from the Clippers](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-22/sports/sp-48640_1_larry-brown) after the 1993 Playoffs and would [coach the Pacers](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/sports/pro-basketball-brown-takes-old-baggage-to-a-new-port.html?pagewanted=all) the next year.\n\n1992 was the first time since 1976 that the Clippers made the playoffs, when they were the Buffalo Braves. The Clippers missed the playoffs for 3 consecutive years with under 30 wins each year before luckily stumbling into the 1997 Playoffs at 36-46. 1992 and 1993 would be the Clippers' last seasons at 0.500 or better until 2006.\n\n###**Indiana Pacers**\n\n- 1993 - 41-41 - Lost 1st Round 3-1 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1994 - 47-35 - Lost ECF 4-3\n- 1995 - 52-30 - Lost ECF 4-3\n- 1996 - 52-30 - Lost 1st Round 3-2 (Reggie Miller missed all but 1 game)\n- 1997 - 39-43 - Missed playoffs\n\nBrown asked Pacers President Donnie Walsh to [let him out of his contract](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-20/sports/9704200365_1_pacers-president-donnie-walsh-larry-brown-reports) near the end of the 1997 season and was eventually replaced by Larry Bird after resigning. Bird would coach the Pacers to 3 consecutive ECF from 1998-2000 and the runner-up in the 2000 NBA Finals. These were the only 3 years that Larry Bird coached any team. \n\nBrown [would coach the Sixers](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/03/sports/larry-brown-meets-with-76ers-brass.html) in the upcoming season.\n\n###**Philadelphia 76ers**\n\n- 1997 - 22-60 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1998 - 31-51 - Missed playoffs\n- 1999 - 28-22 - Lost ECSF 4-0 (lockout season)\n- 2000 - 49-33 - Lost ECSF 4-2\n- 2001 - 56-26 - Lost NBA Finals 4-1\n- 2002 - 43-39 - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n- 2003 - 48-34 - Lost ECSF 4-2\n\nLarry Brown and Allen Iverson had their conflicts in Philadelphia, but [Iverson in 2016 stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ0NfParDgo) that he wished he had bought in to what Larry Brown was telling him. Like David Thompson, Iverson did not win a playoff series without Larry Brown as his coach.\n\nBrown resigned from the Sixers in the 2003 offseason and was [hired by the Pistons](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/02/sports/sp-brown2) after Rick Carlisle was fired. After making 5 consecutive playoffs with Larry Brown, the Sixers would miss the playoffs 3 of 4 years from 2004-2007 after Brown's departure\n\n###**Detroit Pistons**\n\n- 2003 - 50-32 - Lost ECF 4-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2004 - 54-28 - Won NBA Finals 4-1\n- 2005 - 54-28 - Lost NBA Finals 4-3\n\nThe Pistons are the only team Larry Brown coached that had a winning record prior to his arrival. However, even this came under favorable circumstances. \n\nThe 2003 Pistons have the [worst record of any 1-seed in the 4-round format](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7f19h5/statistically_weakest_conferences_in_nba_history/) (1984-present). The 2003 Pistons were barely 0.500 against the Western Conference at [15-13](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/2003/splits/), so it is possible they would have struggled to obtain a winning record in a tougher conference. The 2003 Pistons' 50 wins is not as impressive as it looks, since they competed against 0 other 50-win teams in their conference.\n\nPost-Rasheed Wallace trade, the 2004 Pistons produced the [best defense in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4) statistically. The Pistons would lose the 2005 Finals in 7 games to the Spurs, coached by Larry Brown's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gregg Popovich. \n\nInterestingly, the 2005 Finals was the first time the Spurs under Popovich (as head coach) or Duncan played a Game 7. In their 5 title seasons, the Spurs have only faced two Game 7s. The first was against the 2005 Pistons in the Finals. The second was against the 8-seed 2014 Mavericks in the 1st Round when Duncan and Ginobili had long passed their primes.\n\nThe Pistons [bought out Larry Brown's contract](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2110640) after the 2005 Finals due to suspicions that he was looking for opportunities with other teams. There were rumors that Brown might become the [Cavaliers' president](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2072213) or [seek an opportunity to coach the Knicks](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2016/07/29/detroit-pistons-chauncey-billups-larry-brown/87736896/), which he [would do](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/27/sports/basketball/brown-is-set-to-become-next-coach-of-knicks.html?mtrref=www.google.com) in the upcoming 2005/06 season.\n\nAfter Brown's departure, the Pistons improved in the regular season, reaching 64 and 59 wins in 2006 and 2008, respectively. However, the Pistons regressed in the Playoffs and lost in 3 consecutive ECF after making back to back NBA Finals under Brown, losing the first 2 despite homecourt advantage.\n\nDuring the 2006 Playoffs, many of the Pistons players openly questioned and criticized Brown's replacement, Flip Saunders, and his coaching strategies. [Ben Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1UnxB5XkFs) was perhaps the most vocal critic and [departed in the 2006 offseason](https://youtu.be/EzOFw2Bkef4?t=3351). Tensions between Ben Wallace and Flip Saunders had been building throughout the season and playoffs. The final straw for Ben Wallace was when Saunders benched him for the entire 4th quarter of the 2006 Pistons' final playoff game against the Heat in Game 6 of the ECF.\n\nLarry Brown was strongly against running zone defenses and much preferred man-to-man, but Flip Saunders was strongly in favor of zones. This shift in defensive philosophy contributed to the Pistons' decline.\n\n**More detailed info on Larry Brown and Flip Saunders' contrasting defensive coaching styles**\n\n- **[Quotes](http://2004pistons.blogspot.com)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including player criticism of Saunders\n- **[1-Hour Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including the shift from a man-to-man to a zone scheme after Brown's departure\n\n###**2004 Olympics**\n\nThe one major black mark on Larry Brown's coaching career is USA Basketball's Bronze Medal in the 2004 Olympics. Brown was criticized for [not giving LeBron more minutes](http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer04/basketball/columns/story?id=1861853), Brown himself [criticized the selection process](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/16/us/olympics-basketball-men-s-preliminary-round-world-beater-gone-amiss-us-loses.html), and [Stephon Marbury](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephon-marbury-explains-why-the-2004-olympics-were-the-worst-38-days-of-his-life/) especially did not get along with Brown, which would carry over to Brown's lone season with the Knicks.\n\n###**New York Knicks**\n\n- 2005 - 33-49 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2006 - 23-59 - Missed playoffs\n\n[Brown was fired](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/sports/basketball/09brown.html?mtrref=www.google.com) after just one season with the Knicks. The Knicks had the highest payroll in the league, but finished with the 2nd-worst record in franchise history after the 2015 Knicks at 17-65. \n\nThe Knicks are the only franchise that Larry Brown coached and failed to reach the playoffs with. Every other ABA and NBA team that Brown coached had at least one playoff appearances during their respective years under Brown. Afterwards, the Knicks would still not make the playoffs until 2011, their first appearance since 2004.\n\nLarry Brown was [introduced as the Charlotte Bobcats' coach](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/larry-brown-introduced-head-coach-charlotte-bobcats-article-1.278240) for the 2008/09 season, the ninth and final NBA team he coached.\n\n###**Charlotte Bobcats**\n\n- 2008 - 32-50 - Prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2009 - 35-47 - Missed playoffs\n- 2010 - 44-38 - Lost 1st Round 4-0\n- 2011 - 9-19 Under Brown for 28 games - Missed playoffs\n\n[Brown was fired](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5947959) due to the Bobcats' poor start to the 2011 season. The Bobcats went 25-29 under Paul Silas and finished the year 34-48 to miss the playoffs. \n\nInterestingly, the 2010 Bobcats had the number 1 defense in both PPG allowed and DRTG. However, their poor offense only allowed them to obtain the 7-seed and an eventual sweep at the hands of the Magic. 2010 was the first playoff appearance for Charlotte under the Bobcats' name until 2014.\n\nThe year after Larry Brown left, the 2012 Bobcats had the worst win percentage in NBA history at 0.106 with a 7-66 record in the lockout-shortened season.\n\n###**Brief Summary**\n\n- Larry Brown is the only head coach to win both an NCAA (1988) and NBA Title (2004)\n- Larry Brown coached a record 8 different NBA franchises to the playoffs as well as 2 different ABA franchises\n- This is despite the fact that Brown only inherited one team with a winning record in either the ABA or NBA; the 2003 Pistons who benefited from an incredibly weak East.\n- The only winning team that Larry Brown inherited made 2 consecutive NBA Finals under Brown, winning one of them\n- Allen Iverson and David Thompson did not win a playoff series without Larry Brown coaching them\n"}, {"id": "dr1cysh", "body": "It\u2019s pretty incredible that he could be that extremely effective from the ABA to 2010, coaching in three different leagues "}, {"id": "dr1cysh", "body": "It\u2019s pretty incredible that he could be that extremely effective from the ABA to 2010, coaching in three different leagues "}, {"id": "dr1haee", "body": "2016* he revitalized SMU to a consistent ncaa tourney team too. \n\n*I forgot when he retired to lazy to google "}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7iu1ej", "body": "In both the ABA and NBA, all but one team that Larry Brown coached had a 0.500 or worse record the year prior to his arrival.

However, even this came under favorable circumstances. \n\nThe 2003 Pistons have the [worst record of any 1-seed in the 4-round format](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7f19h5/statistically_weakest_conferences_in_nba_history/) (1984-present). The 2003 Pistons were barely 0.500 against the Western Conference at [15-13](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/2003/splits/), so it is possible they would have struggled to obtain a winning record in a tougher conference. The 2003 Pistons' 50 wins is not as impressive as it looks, since they competed against 0 other 50-win teams in their conference.\n\nPost-Rasheed Wallace trade, the 2004 Pistons produced the [best defense in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4) statistically. The Pistons would lose the 2005 Finals in 7 games to the Spurs, coached by Larry Brown's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gregg Popovich. \n\nInterestingly, the 2005 Finals was the first time the Spurs under Popovich (as head coach) or Duncan played a Game 7. In their 5 title seasons, the Spurs have only faced two Game 7s. The first was against the 2005 Pistons in the Finals. The second was against the 8-seed 2014 Mavericks in the 1st Round when Duncan and Ginobili had long passed their primes.\n\nThe Pistons [bought out Larry Brown's contract](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2110640) after the 2005 Finals due to suspicions that he was looking for opportunities with other teams.

However, the Pistons regressed in the Playoffs and lost in 3 consecutive ECF after making back to back NBA Finals under Brown, losing the first 2 despite homecourt advantage.\n\nDuring the 2006 Playoffs, many of the Pistons players openly questioned and criticized Brown's replacement, Flip Saunders, and his coaching strategies. [Ben Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1UnxB5XkFs) was perhaps the most vocal critic and [departed in the 2006 offseason](https://youtu.be/EzOFw2Bkef4?t=3351). Tensions between Ben Wallace and Flip Saunders had been building throughout the season and playoffs. The final straw for Ben Wallace was when Saunders benched him for the entire 4th quarter of the 2006 Pistons' final playoff game against the Heat in Game 6 of the ECF.\n\nLarry Brown was strongly against running zone defenses and much preferred man-to-man, but Flip Saunders was strongly in favor of zones. This shift in defensive philosophy contributed to the Pistons' decline.\n\n**More detailed info on Larry Brown and Flip Saunders' contrasting defensive coaching styles**\n\n- **[Quotes](http://2004pistons.blogspot.com)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including player criticism of Saunders\n- **[1-Hour Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including the shift from a man-to-man to a zone scheme after Brown's departure\n\n###**2004 Olympics**\n\nThe one major black mark on Larry Brown's coaching career is USA Basketball's Bronze Medal in the 2004 Olympics.

The Knicks had the highest payroll in the league, but finished with the 2nd-worst record in franchise history after the 2015 Knicks at 17-65. \n\nThe Knicks are the only franchise that Larry Brown coached and failed to reach the playoffs with. Every other ABA and NBA team that Brown coached had at least one playoff appearances during their respective years under Brown.

However, their poor offense only allowed them to obtain the 7-seed and an eventual sweep at the hands of the Magic. 2010 was the first playoff appearance for Charlotte under the Bobcats' name until 2014.\n\nThe year after Larry Brown left, the 2012 Bobcats had the worst win percentage in NBA history at 0.106 with a 7-66 record in the lockout-shortened season.\n\n###**Brief Summary**\n\n- Larry Brown is the only head coach to win both an NCAA (1988) and NBA Title (2004)\n- Larry Brown coached a record 8 different NBA franchises to the playoffs as well as 2 different ABA franchises\n- This is despite the fact that Brown only inherited one team with a winning record in either the ABA or NBA; the 2003 Pistons who benefited from an incredibly weak East.\n- The only winning team that Larry Brown inherited made 2 consecutive NBA Finals under Brown, winning one of them\n- Allen Iverson and David Thompson did not win a playoff series without Larry Brown coaching them\n"}, {"id": "dr1gixh", "body": "Larry Brown was also one of the most disliked coaches ever by players so there\u2019s that"}, {"id": "dr1gixh", "body": "Larry Brown was also one of the most disliked coaches ever by players so there\u2019s that"}, {"id": "dr2501q", "body": "That's part of why he never stayed long with a team."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7iu1ej", "body": "In both the ABA and NBA, all but one team that Larry Brown coached had a 0.500 or worse record the year prior to his arrival.

Even then, Brown only coached New York for one season in 2005/06. \n\nOut of 31 seasons as an ABA/NBA coach, including partial seasons, Larry Brown's teams \n\n- had winning records under him for 24 seasons\n- had losing records under him for 6 seasons\n- had 1 season exactly at 0.500\n\nLarry Brown coached a record 8 different NBA franchises to the NBA Playoffs and coached 2 different ABA franchises to the ABA Playoffs. However, this also led to Brown's negative reputation for quickly and suddenly departing from one team to another.\n\nBrown is also the only head coach to win both an NCAA (1988) and NBA title (2004).\n\n###**Carolina Cougars (ABA)**\n\n- 1972 - 35-49 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1973 - 57-27 - Lost EDF 4-3 (equivalent to ECF)\n- 1974 - 47-37 - Lost EDSF 4-0 (equivalent to ECSF)\n\nAfter Larry Brown's departure, the Carolina Cougars would become the Spirits of St. Louis and finished 32-52 and 35-49 in the 1975 and 1976 seasons, respectively. They did make the 1975 EDF even with a poor record, however.\n\n###**Denver Nuggets (ABA)**\n\n- 1974 - 37-47 - Lost 1st Round Tiebreaker 1-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1975 - 65-19 - Lost WDF 4-3 (equivalent to WCF)\n- 1976 - 60-24 - Lost ABA Finals 4-2\n\n###**Denver Nuggets (NBA)**\n\n- 1977 - 50-32 - Lost WCSF 4-2\n- 1978 - 48-34 - Lost WCF 4-2\n- 1979 - 28-25 - Under Brown for 53 games - Lost 1st Round 2-1\n\nAfter Brown [resigned midseason](http://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/25/archives/larry-brown-in-the-ucla-pressure-cooker.html) to coach UCLA, the 1979 Nuggets went 19-10 under Donnie Walsh to finish the year 47-35. The Lakers would beat Denver 2-1 in the 1st Round. \n\nAfterwards, the Nuggets missed the 1980 and 1981 Playoffs with 30-52 and 37-45 records, respectively. Doug Moe would coach the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 1982-1990 including a 1985 WCF appearance. \n\nThe only two years in which the Nuggets' franchise player, David Thompson, won a playoff series were under Larry Brown in 1976 and 1978.\n\nBrown would coach UCLA to the 1980 NCAA Title Game, but they lost to Louisville 59-54 and later had their appearance vacated due to two players being found ineligible. Brown would then coach the New Jersey Nets in the upcoming season.\n\n###**New Jersey Nets**\n\n- 1981 - 24-58 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1982 - 44-38 - Lost 1st Round 2-0\n- 1983 - 47-29 - Under Brown for 76 games - Lost 1st Round 2-0\n\nBrown [resigned near the end of the season](http://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/08/sports/brown-resigns-as-nets-coach-to-take-job-at-kansas.html) to coach Kansas. Kansas would win the 1988 NCAA Title under Brown despite being a 6-seed and finishing the year at 27-11, the most losses for an NCAA Champion. \n\nThe Nets went 2-4 under Bill Blair to end the 1983 season and were swept in the 1st Round 2-0 by the Knicks. After Brown's departure, the Nets would lose in the 1984 ECSF, followed by two 1st Round exits.\n\nLarry Brown [left Kansas](http://articles.latimes.com/1988-06-14/sports/sp-4299_1_san-antonio) after winning the NCAA title to coach the Spurs. After his departure, Kansas was banned from the 1989 NCAA Tournament due to recruiting violations. This is the only time a reigning NCAA Champion was banned from the tournament.\n\nAlthough this did not involve any of Brown's players, Brown and others [had given money](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/11/sports/sports-of-the-times-brown-skips-town-again.html) to a potential recruit in Vincent Askew. Brown claimed that Askew needed it for a plane trip to visit his ill grandmother, but Askew used it to pay for an aunt's phone bill in addition to a plane ticket.\n\n###**San Antonio Spurs**\n\n- 1988 - 31-51 - Lost 1st Round 3-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1989 - 21-61 - Missed playoffs \n- 1990 - 56-26 - Lost WCSF 4-3\n - The 1990 Spurs underwent a massive roster overhaul with the additions of Terry Cummings, Rod Strickland, and rookies David Robinson and Sean Elliott. All 4 of these players would become new starters for the Spurs. \n- 1991 - 55-27 - Lost 1st Round 3-1\n- 1992 - 21-17 - Under Brown for 38 games - Lost 1st Round 3-0\n\nLarry Brown was [fired by the Spurs](http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-22/sports/sp-430_1_brown) in the middle of the 1992 season and went on to [coach the Clippers that same year](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/222758/1992-NBA-PLAYOFFS-COLOR-BROWN-SUCCESSFUL-NEW-CLIPPER-COACH-HAS-A--HISTORY-OF-TAKING-TEAMS-HES.html). The Spurs would go 26-18 under Bob Bass to finish the year at 47-35 and were swept 3-0 in the 1st Round of the 1992 Playoffs by the Suns.\n\nThe Spurs would still find success after Brown's departure, making the playoffs every year afterwards, with the exception of David Robinson's injury season in 1997.\n\nGregg Popovich first became involved in NBA coaching [as an assistant under Larry Brown](https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/larry-brown-cut-gregg-popovich-twice-still-proud-231940689--nba.html) in the 1988/89 season with the Spurs. Earlier, Brown had cut Popovich during tryouts for the Nuggets when Brown was still coaching in Denver. \n\nPopovich would later become a volunteer assistant under Larry Brown with Kansas from 1986-1987. When Brown left Kansas to coach the Spurs, he offered Popovich to join him as an assistant coach in San Antonio.\n\nGregg Popovich has credited Larry Brown for helping to develop him as a coach. Just before Brown and Popovich's respective teams faced off in the 2005 Finals, [Popovich stated](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/best-friends-brown-and-popovich-foes-in-nba-finals/) \u201cWithout him, I wouldn\u2019t be here, so it\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d\n\n###**Los Angeles Clippers**\n\n- 1991 - 31-51 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1992 - 23-12 - Under Brown for 35 games - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n - The 1992 Clippers were 22-25 prior to Brown's midseason arrival and finished the season 45-37\n- 1993 - 41-41 - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n\nBrown [resigned from the Clippers](http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-22/sports/sp-48640_1_larry-brown) after the 1993 Playoffs and would [coach the Pacers](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/sports/pro-basketball-brown-takes-old-baggage-to-a-new-port.html?pagewanted=all) the next year.\n\n1992 was the first time since 1976 that the Clippers made the playoffs, when they were the Buffalo Braves. The Clippers missed the playoffs for 3 consecutive years with under 30 wins each year before luckily stumbling into the 1997 Playoffs at 36-46. 1992 and 1993 would be the Clippers' last seasons at 0.500 or better until 2006.\n\n###**Indiana Pacers**\n\n- 1993 - 41-41 - Lost 1st Round 3-1 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1994 - 47-35 - Lost ECF 4-3\n- 1995 - 52-30 - Lost ECF 4-3\n- 1996 - 52-30 - Lost 1st Round 3-2 (Reggie Miller missed all but 1 game)\n- 1997 - 39-43 - Missed playoffs\n\nBrown asked Pacers President Donnie Walsh to [let him out of his contract](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-20/sports/9704200365_1_pacers-president-donnie-walsh-larry-brown-reports) near the end of the 1997 season and was eventually replaced by Larry Bird after resigning. Bird would coach the Pacers to 3 consecutive ECF from 1998-2000 and the runner-up in the 2000 NBA Finals. These were the only 3 years that Larry Bird coached any team. \n\nBrown [would coach the Sixers](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/03/sports/larry-brown-meets-with-76ers-brass.html) in the upcoming season.\n\n###**Philadelphia 76ers**\n\n- 1997 - 22-60 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 1998 - 31-51 - Missed playoffs\n- 1999 - 28-22 - Lost ECSF 4-0 (lockout season)\n- 2000 - 49-33 - Lost ECSF 4-2\n- 2001 - 56-26 - Lost NBA Finals 4-1\n- 2002 - 43-39 - Lost 1st Round 3-2\n- 2003 - 48-34 - Lost ECSF 4-2\n\nLarry Brown and Allen Iverson had their conflicts in Philadelphia, but [Iverson in 2016 stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ0NfParDgo) that he wished he had bought in to what Larry Brown was telling him. Like David Thompson, Iverson did not win a playoff series without Larry Brown as his coach.\n\nBrown resigned from the Sixers in the 2003 offseason and was [hired by the Pistons](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/02/sports/sp-brown2) after Rick Carlisle was fired. After making 5 consecutive playoffs with Larry Brown, the Sixers would miss the playoffs 3 of 4 years from 2004-2007 after Brown's departure\n\n###**Detroit Pistons**\n\n- 2003 - 50-32 - Lost ECF 4-0 - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2004 - 54-28 - Won NBA Finals 4-1\n- 2005 - 54-28 - Lost NBA Finals 4-3\n\nThe Pistons are the only team Larry Brown coached that had a winning record prior to his arrival. However, even this came under favorable circumstances. \n\nThe 2003 Pistons have the [worst record of any 1-seed in the 4-round format](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7f19h5/statistically_weakest_conferences_in_nba_history/) (1984-present). The 2003 Pistons were barely 0.500 against the Western Conference at [15-13](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/2003/splits/), so it is possible they would have struggled to obtain a winning record in a tougher conference. The 2003 Pistons' 50 wins is not as impressive as it looks, since they competed against 0 other 50-win teams in their conference.\n\nPost-Rasheed Wallace trade, the 2004 Pistons produced the [best defense in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4) statistically. The Pistons would lose the 2005 Finals in 7 games to the Spurs, coached by Larry Brown's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gregg Popovich. \n\nInterestingly, the 2005 Finals was the first time the Spurs under Popovich (as head coach) or Duncan played a Game 7. In their 5 title seasons, the Spurs have only faced two Game 7s. The first was against the 2005 Pistons in the Finals. The second was against the 8-seed 2014 Mavericks in the 1st Round when Duncan and Ginobili had long passed their primes.\n\nThe Pistons [bought out Larry Brown's contract](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2110640) after the 2005 Finals due to suspicions that he was looking for opportunities with other teams. There were rumors that Brown might become the [Cavaliers' president](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2072213) or [seek an opportunity to coach the Knicks](https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/pistons/2016/07/29/detroit-pistons-chauncey-billups-larry-brown/87736896/), which he [would do](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/27/sports/basketball/brown-is-set-to-become-next-coach-of-knicks.html?mtrref=www.google.com) in the upcoming 2005/06 season.\n\nAfter Brown's departure, the Pistons improved in the regular season, reaching 64 and 59 wins in 2006 and 2008, respectively. However, the Pistons regressed in the Playoffs and lost in 3 consecutive ECF after making back to back NBA Finals under Brown, losing the first 2 despite homecourt advantage.\n\nDuring the 2006 Playoffs, many of the Pistons players openly questioned and criticized Brown's replacement, Flip Saunders, and his coaching strategies. [Ben Wallace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1UnxB5XkFs) was perhaps the most vocal critic and [departed in the 2006 offseason](https://youtu.be/EzOFw2Bkef4?t=3351). Tensions between Ben Wallace and Flip Saunders had been building throughout the season and playoffs. The final straw for Ben Wallace was when Saunders benched him for the entire 4th quarter of the 2006 Pistons' final playoff game against the Heat in Game 6 of the ECF.\n\nLarry Brown was strongly against running zone defenses and much preferred man-to-man, but Flip Saunders was strongly in favor of zones. This shift in defensive philosophy contributed to the Pistons' decline.\n\n**More detailed info on Larry Brown and Flip Saunders' contrasting defensive coaching styles**\n\n- **[Quotes](http://2004pistons.blogspot.com)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including player criticism of Saunders\n- **[1-Hour Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzOFw2Bkef4)** on 2004-2006 Pistons defensive strategies, including the shift from a man-to-man to a zone scheme after Brown's departure\n\n###**2004 Olympics**\n\nThe one major black mark on Larry Brown's coaching career is USA Basketball's Bronze Medal in the 2004 Olympics. Brown was criticized for [not giving LeBron more minutes](http://www.espn.com/olympics/summer04/basketball/columns/story?id=1861853), Brown himself [criticized the selection process](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/16/us/olympics-basketball-men-s-preliminary-round-world-beater-gone-amiss-us-loses.html), and [Stephon Marbury](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/stephon-marbury-explains-why-the-2004-olympics-were-the-worst-38-days-of-his-life/) especially did not get along with Brown, which would carry over to Brown's lone season with the Knicks.\n\n###**New York Knicks**\n\n- 2005 - 33-49 - Missed playoffs - prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2006 - 23-59 - Missed playoffs\n\n[Brown was fired](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/sports/basketball/09brown.html?mtrref=www.google.com) after just one season with the Knicks. The Knicks had the highest payroll in the league, but finished with the 2nd-worst record in franchise history after the 2015 Knicks at 17-65. \n\nThe Knicks are the only franchise that Larry Brown coached and failed to reach the playoffs with. Every other ABA and NBA team that Brown coached had at least one playoff appearances during their respective years under Brown. Afterwards, the Knicks would still not make the playoffs until 2011, their first appearance since 2004.\n\nLarry Brown was [introduced as the Charlotte Bobcats' coach](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/larry-brown-introduced-head-coach-charlotte-bobcats-article-1.278240) for the 2008/09 season, the ninth and final NBA team he coached.\n\n###**Charlotte Bobcats**\n\n- 2008 - 32-50 - Prior to Brown's arrival\n- 2009 - 35-47 - Missed playoffs\n- 2010 - 44-38 - Lost 1st Round 4-0\n- 2011 - 9-19 Under Brown for 28 games - Missed playoffs\n\n[Brown was fired](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5947959) due to the Bobcats' poor start to the 2011 season.
