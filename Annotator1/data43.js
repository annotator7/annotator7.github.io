For some reason, it came as a surprise to me, even though I watched the last 8 Finals. Iggy was near the 20+pts per game in those last 4 games. So Iggy sealed it with defense AND the offense, so you are right, I was wrong. \n\nI'd still like to say that Roberson's offensive / free throw liability is outweighed by  key blocks and steals and his hustle. \n\nSo, I have acknowledged his weaknesses on offense right from the get go, I just think with the makeup of OKC's current team, his offense isn't needed. He cleans up plays, and hounds the people he is set on. And if googling his latest, he got some key defensive plays that allowed OKC to win it. \n\nWith the last 2 min liability on free throws, he's not alone, and coaches take them out and put them in. Same with point guards that are liability on defense. Take 'em out, then put them back in. \n\nAnd, he's not horrible on shots, his average distance this year is close to 7 ft, and shooting it at 53%. Don't deny that he sucks at free throws, I feel he does enough to compensate and contribute to the team's victory much more with his defense."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mi8mq", "body": "Personally I hear nothing about Tobias Harris but the guy has been on a tear this year "}, {"id": "dru4qfz", "body": "Tyreke Evans"}, {"id": "dru4qfz", "body": "Tyreke Evans"}, {"id": "drudvjz", "body": "If we weren\u2019t ass he\u2019s 6MOY no question "}, {"id": "drudvjz", "body": "If we weren\u2019t ass he\u2019s 6MOY no question "}, {"id": "drufz56", "body": "He's started a ton of games though hasn't he"}, {"id": "drufz56", "body": "He's started a ton of games though hasn't he"}, {"id": "drug553", "body": "Right, that\u2019s why I noted if we weren\u2019t ass because if Conley stayed healthy and the whole Marc-Fizz fiasco didn\u2019t happen he\u2019d prob still come off the bench "}, {"id": "drug553", "body": "Right, that\u2019s why I noted if we weren\u2019t ass because if Conley stayed healthy and the whole Marc-Fizz fiasco didn\u2019t happen he\u2019d prob still come off the bench "}, {"id": "drukhe6", "body": "Alot of ifs, the griz we bound to suck with so many new players and an aging core."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mi8mq", "body": "Personally I hear nothing about Tobias Harris but the guy has been on a tear this year "}, {"id": "dru4r8r", "body": "Mike 'Big Shot' Scott.
