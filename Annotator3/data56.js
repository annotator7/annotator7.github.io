Something like X number of players that are top Y in the league or top Z at their positions. And also, what teams fit your criteria. \n\n#all stars don't count (to me) because the best teams will usually end with 1 or 2 players that make the ASG even if they wouldn't be better than other players in a vacuum, most glaring example being the 4 atlanta hawks that went a couple years ago just because the Hawks were really god overall.

Coming back after a good win against the Cavs, but it was a sloppy one. Let's hope for a cleaner game.\n\nWatched the Utah-Denver game last night, and safe to say, if the Jazz play like they did yesterday, it's going to be a long night for everyone in Utah. Excited to watch Mitchell against the Dubs.\n\nSome thoughts on the game :\n\n* First information of the night is that both Bell &amp; McCaw are back on the bench. Also, Sefolosha in the starting line-up for the Jazz who steps in for Jerebko who started last night.\n\n* Warriors attacking Rubio every time they get the chance, gonna be a tough night for him. Rubio cannot do anything, they're exploiting him so hard by switching him on KD.\n\n* We're sleeping a bit on defense to start the game, we're there on the passing lanes but Utah is figuring it out and are very smart about their offense. And contrary to last night's first quarter, shots are going in.\n\n* Man do I love when McCaw is aggressive like that, confidence is up there for him. KD's timing on blocks is something else. Bell is a great spark off the bench, 5 rebounds, 2 of them on the offensive end.\n\n* 23-24, both teams shooting 38%, Klay didn't get a lot of looks early like he usually does. Defenses took a while to settle but both teams are playing pretty aggressively on that end.\n\n* Rodney Hood is ice cold tonight. West still has some jump, Dray to West alley-oop was a nice play, wakes up the crowd, they're snoozing for now. I can't really blame them, game has no real rhythm.\n\n* Draymond is everywhere tonight. I wish he would attack the paint more often, he's fairly good at it and often draws foul when he does. Utah's ball movement is a treat to watch, one of the reason I love to see this match-up, wish The Stifle Tower was here.\n\n* It looks like we forgot about rim protection this game, nobody to box out Favors, he's playing really well right now, rolling &amp; rebounding. He's getting everything he wants. That KD block was so clean, can't get all calls right, he did slightly touch the shoulder.\n\n* 48-47, Dubs need to figure out a way to defend Favors, he is feasting right now, he already had 4 Orebs. We're also off on the other end, no run, shots aren't falling. I've rarely seen a crowd this dead at Oracle.\n\n* Starting the 3rd with a great shooting display, both KD &amp; Klay hit a three and just like that, Dubs take the biggest lead of the night with 8.\n\n* Utah is back within one after a 9-0 run led by Rubio, it felt like they were not respecting his ability to drive and lay it in. That said, I'm liking our ball movement a lot more to start the second half.\n\n* Mitchell can jump man. 10th straight game with multiple blocks for KD, defense has picked up during the third quarter. Draymond Green is on triple-double alert.\n\n* The same can be said for the offense, overall, the Dubs are playing way better right now. KD just got back to back dunks where Green found him perfectly. 12/15 shooting for the third up until now.\n\n* 90-66, a fantastic 42-22 quarter for the Dubs, McCaw is having himself a great night, I've said it a lot in these write-ups but I love when he attacks the basket like that, and he's doing it and it's working really well. That was a brutal quarter. Finally the crowd wakes up\n\n* The 3rd quarter Warriors strikes against, it was the fifth time this year the Dubs outscored a team by 20 or more during the 3rd quarter. West and Swaggy P are starting the 4th shooting really well.\n\n* 3 minutes into the 4th and the Dubs have a 27 points lead, the Jazz are out of it, back to back at Denver and then against the Warriors must be hardcore. They were keeping up during the first half but they look exhausted right now.\n\n* #LOONEYWATCH in the 4th quarter with 5 minutes left, let's go big man, tear it up. \n\n* Fuck, Casspi rolled is right ankle pretty badly, it was without contact, let's hope it's nothing, hate to see those injuries.\n\n* Season high for Pat, a nice three pointer that followed a great block from JaVale. Mitchell didn't have a great night, but he has free pass in the 4th, taking and making a lot of his shots, and a thunderous dunk.\n\nOverall, the game was decided, like often with the Dubs, in the third quarter, they turned on the jets and the Jazz couldn't keep up like they did in the first half. McCaw had a great night, so did Draymond &amp; KD. Favors was great.\n\nNext one is against Charlotte @ Oracle, don't think Curry will be back. \n\nGood night."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mnts8", "body": "Here is a place to have in depth, x's and o's, discussions on yesterday's games.

That often happens in markets where supply is lagged like housing or farming because it takes so long to make more, it doesn't exclusively happen there though. Deflation is probably the biggest worry, but since governments usually do everything possible to avoid deflation it really may not be a concern. Any significant change to the market may spook the fuck out of people and they'll jump ship though, a lot of the people in there aren't investors, just nerds that liked the idea of crypto currency. However, nerds that like crypto currency are also probably pretty smart. \n\nI don't know, I probably am missing something. I'm far from an economic genius. \n\nThe dotcom bubble is what I forgot! They are similar in an important way, but dissimilar in an equally important way. The dotcom bubble was driven by speculative investment, but when internet companied failed to create a profit and went out of business people lost all their money. People can invest in Bitcoin for two main reasons: a strong preference for crypto currency, or speculative profit. So there is speculation in the market that is bound to lose quite a bit of steam. However, bitcoins profit is driven by how supply interacts with the value of other currencies. That's why deflation is concerning. The dotcom bubble burst because of a dependence on firm profit, something Bitcoin doesn't suffer from. A discovered lapse in the security of Bitcoin is actually probably the biggest concern, by like a mile. As little as I know about economics, I know so much less about comp sci. So I have no clue how likely that lapse is to exist.

There's pretty much fouls and holds on every play if people want to nitpick on every play. Much of the time those calls get dictated by streaks or runs and the home crowd. You're absolutely right that most ppl don't give a shit until it comes down to the end of the game. Which is kind of a shame since before the last 19 seconds where fouls were forced to be taken, Cleveland took one shy of 2x as many free throw attempts. However, that's not even close to being part of any conversation about this game. The bad calls went both ways but the ones that happen at the end just feel infinitely more important.\n\nThat being said, NBA basketball is impossibly difficult to be flawless when it comes to officiating. Players inherently understand this and use every trick in the book to game the system and gain every advantage they can. Some players are better at this than others and there's always going to be questionable/missed calls so officials end up having to balance a level of how egregious a violation is with how much they feel impacts the game and they have to do it in a fraction of a second. I honestly didn't understand how hard this was, watching NBA games on TV, until I did some reffing IRL - you just don't want to have to stop the game every 20 seconds unless it's really getting out of hand.\n\nSo.... honestly, when it comes to this \"rivalry\" I don't really think W/L is a great indicator of the better team that day unless the point differential was &gt;10 just due to the impossible reffing for these games just as we have some coefficient of error for scientific measurements and what not. But that's not exactly how sports works so we're just gonna have to live with there being a lot of errors I guess.
