Zeller can actually stretch the floor a bit and give some space around the basket, allowing him to be a pretty effective weapon. His ability to guard anyone from Curry to LeBron is still his most valuable skill, though. Not many players can do that.\n\nPeople love to hate utility guys like MKG, but he's a very valuable player.

The point is that KD rarely can create the chaos Steph creates for a defense because you've got maybe 1 or 2 guys on a team that can mark KD, whereas its everyones fucking job to make sure Steph isnt open. This means as Steph drags people around through screens and so on, every single time each defender has the make the decision to hope someone else got him or chase/bite on Steph. Since two people have an instant to make that call, often they both do the same thing and either Steph or the other Warrior is open. Every time Steph drags, cuts, runs around in general the three closest people to him have to start thinking about when help D is required and might give their man an open look. \n\nSteph creates so much more because of this, while basically most of the people KD drags around know they are the 6'8+ man and they can't let some 6'3 guy get switched onto KD. That's what Stephs gravity is and his major selling point over Lebron or KD. Theoretically everyone on a basketball court is physically capable of marking 6'3 180~ pound Steph. The decision to mark KD or Lebron is already a hard no for most guards in the league and they will always try to follow the smaller dude and hope whoever is guarding LBJ/KD makes it over the screen.

Although I do believe the turnovers are a big problem in Embiid's game, any player that has that high of a usage usually has a higher number of turnovers.  I will say, even though their TOV% are within 1% of each other's, I would think that Oden may have turned the ball over less overall as he was not the playmaker Embiid is, nor did he command the ball further from 10ft of the basket.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmbiid's 2p% is significantly lower than Oden's, but their shot selection is so different it's hard to say that I'd rather have Oden shooting than Embiid.  Embiid's shooting touch is so good for his experience that he keeps a very flexible balance of shot selection, which allows for a more open floor -  while Oden shot 94% of his shots between 0-10 feet:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Greg Oden Shooting**\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||2-Pt|||3-Pt|||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|\n||||||||||% of||||||FG% |||||||Dunk|||Corn||Heav||\n|Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|G|MP|FG%|Dist.|2P|0-3|3-10|10-16|16 3|3P|2P|0-3|3-10|10-16|16 3|3P|%Astd|%FGA|Md.|%Astd|%3PA|3P%|Att.|Md.|\n|Career|||NBA||105|2028|.574|2.6|1.000|.670|.279|.049|.002|.000|.574|.684|.364|.296|.000||.536|.299|152||||0|0|\n\n\nProvided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/odengr01.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#shooting)\nGenerated 12/4/2017.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Joel Embiid Shooting**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||2-Pt|||3-Pt|||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|\n||||||||||% of||||||FG% |||||||Dunk|||Corn||Heav||\n|Season|Age|Tm|Lg|Pos|G|MP|FG%|Dist.|2P|0-3|3-10|10-16|16 3|3P|2P|0-3|3-10|10-16|16 3|3P|%Astd|%FGA|Md.|%Astd|%3PA|3P%|Att.|Md.|\n|Career|||NBA||50|1350|.473|10.6|.797|.339|.176|.199|.083|.203|.512|.669|.364|.403|.452|.322|.507|.077|50|.959|.046|.143|0|0|\n\n\nProvided by [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.sports-reference.com/sharing.html?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool): [View Original Table](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html?sr&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=Share&amp;utm_campaign=ShareTool#shooting)\nGenerated 12/4/2017.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, this is where we stand now with the Oden vs Embiid Debate - Even though Embiid has played 55 less games than Greg Oden, he has surpassed him in most aspects.  However, Oden was better at taking care of the ball, within 10 ft of the basket, and offensive rebounding. All things that Embiid can improve on, though I will say it's more difficult to be an elite offensive rebounder and stretch the floor at the same time. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nInjury will **always** be a concern for Embiid, as it was for Oden. That's the root of this debate. And, though Embiid is not out of the woods yet from such a comparison, everything is pointing in the right direction.\n"}, {"id": "dqrevct", "body": "The comparison isn\u2019t because of numbers and you know that.
