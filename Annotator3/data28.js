Ex:11-12 Rockets finished 17th before trading for Harden. Tanking horribly may have worked for the sixers,because of Joel Embiids injuries/EuroStash,Okafor and Noel not panning out,and Ben Simmons foot injury. Although if done VERY properly panic rebuilds can be done right Ex:12-13 Celtics.\n\n\nTanking can have it pros but it'll be much harder with the leagues new lottery rules.
