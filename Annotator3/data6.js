We don't have cap space or extra assets that we can use to add players that can contribute this season. Plus, in my opinion we are several moves away from being even a threat in the East making a quick rebuild very difficult. Memphis might also blow it up and have similar assets to us, so getting an early start will give the team more options. \n\t\n\tEven though Kemba is my favorite Hornet ever, blowing it up should start with him. After getting back some pieces or picks to build around we could part out some of our other desirable players to make cap space to take on bad contracts in exchange for picks. I love Kemba and his game but the market value for undersized point guards is not high so I tried to think of realistic trades. I don't think we can get Fultz or another top level prospect for Kemba straight up because of his age and how he plays. This also limits the search to teams that are contending for a playoff spot and have a need for a PG. Plus Kemba deserves to play in the spotlight on a real contender. \n\n- Kemba Walker is having a career year at 27 with 2 Years at $12,000,000 left on his contract which makes him one of the easier stars to move.  \n    \n\t- Denver (The most obvious spot for him)\n      \n\t  - Beasley, Murray, and Arthur for Kemba\n      \n\t      - Analysis- This would give the Hornets a young backcourt core of Monk, Beasley, and Murray that we could build around. Would allow the Hornets to move Lamb (who's also on a friendly contract) who could be a desirable rotation player for a contender at the deadline.

Kemba would give them an experienced veteran that can help Oladipo and Turner in their development. It would also give them a dynamic scorer to compliment Oladipo. The Hornets get a young big man that is a more dynamic big than anyone on our roster, we take on Jefferson's contract in exchange for first from a team that could be picking in the mid-late 20's. \n    \n- Minnesota (Would have to wait until Gibson is eligible to be traded)\n\n        - Gibson, Patton, and a first for Walker and O'Bryant\n\n            - Analysis- Minnesota is pretty devoid of young talent that they are willing to part with. Patton is a piece that might not be worth building around but could be a great rotation player. The Hornets take on Gibson's contract to make the deal work. Minnesota gets a spark plug that is desperately needed there and allows Teague to run the second unit. (I am not a huge fan of the deal, it would most likely end up being a late first and I don't think Patton is someone to build around (although I have not watched him play that much). \n    \n- Detroit\n        - They need a point guard but it was hard to find an asset on the team worth trading Walker away for. \n    \n- NYK\n        - Nitilinka, McDermont, Dotson, and Lottery Protected 1st for Kemba \n\n            - Analysis- Nitilinka gives us a chance to play Monk more. Nitilinka could guard the larger(better) opposing guard and the two of them could share ball handling responsibilities. McDermont and Dotson are thrown in to make the contracts work. New York would get a running mate for Porzingis and increases their odds of making the playoffs. \n\n        - Nitilinka, McDermont, Noah, Thomas, unprotected pick for Batum and Walker (2nd Favorite)\n\n            - We take on Noah's horrible contract (helps us tank) in exchange for making the pick unprotected and the Knicks taking an extra year on Batum's contract. Batum could fill an immediate need on their roster. \n                - I like this trade because if we blow up the roster then that 4th year of Batum's massive contract would hinder a developmental timeline.

Patton is a piece that might not be worth building around but could be a great rotation player. The Hornets take on Gibson's contract to make the deal work. Minnesota gets a spark plug that is desperately needed there and allows Teague to run the second unit.

Batum could fill an immediate need on their roster. \n                - I like this trade because if we blow up the roster then that 4th year of Batum's massive contract would hinder a developmental timeline.

We don't have cap space or extra assets that we can use to add players that can contribute this season. Plus, in my opinion we are several moves away from being even a threat in the East making a quick rebuild very difficult. Memphis might also blow it up and have similar assets to us, so getting an early start will give the team more options. \n\t\n\tEven though Kemba is my favorite Hornet ever, blowing it up should start with him. After getting back some pieces or picks to build around we could part out some of our other desirable players to make cap space to take on bad contracts in exchange for picks. I love Kemba and his game but the market value for undersized point guards is not high so I tried to think of realistic trades. I don't think we can get Fultz or another top level prospect for Kemba straight up because of his age and how he plays. This also limits the search to teams that are contending for a playoff spot and have a need for a PG. Plus Kemba deserves to play in the spotlight on a real contender. \n\n- Kemba Walker is having a career year at 27 with 2 Years at $12,000,000 left on his contract which makes him one of the easier stars to move.  \n    \n\t- Denver (The most obvious spot for him)\n      \n\t  - Beasley, Murray, and Arthur for Kemba\n      \n\t      - Analysis- This would give the Hornets a young backcourt core of Monk, Beasley, and Murray that we could build around. Would allow the Hornets to move Lamb (who's also on a friendly contract) who could be a desirable rotation player for a contender at the deadline. The Nuggets get a true point guard that would make them a scary match up in the playoffs. (Favorite Choice)\n    \n\t- Indy (The fact that they might be buyers at the deadline and the Hornets are a mess is startling)\n        \n\t- Al Jefferson, Sabonis, and a First for Kemba and Frank\n            \n\t- Analysis- I don't know how much the Pacers are attached to their young big man but Frank can help replace him. Kemba would give them an experienced veteran that can help Oladipo and Turner in their development. It would also give them a dynamic scorer to compliment Oladipo. The Hornets get a young big man that is a more dynamic big than anyone on our roster, we take on Jefferson's contract in exchange for first from a team that could be picking in the mid-late 20's. \n    \n- Minnesota (Would have to wait until Gibson is eligible to be traded)\n\n        - Gibson, Patton, and a first for Walker and O'Bryant\n\n            - Analysis- Minnesota is pretty devoid of young talent that they are willing to part with. Patton is a piece that might not be worth building around but could be a great rotation player. The Hornets take on Gibson's contract to make the deal work. Minnesota gets a spark plug that is desperately needed there and allows Teague to run the second unit.
