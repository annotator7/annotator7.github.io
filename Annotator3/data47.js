They have the best bench in the league and continue to rely on KD to win games.\n\n2. **Houston Rockets** - I'm not sold on the Rockets struggling. Once they get Capela back, the league will see just how truly fearsome a MDA led offense is again.\n\n3. **Toronto Raptors** - Don't sleep on The North. The Lowry/DeRozan combo along with the a top 5 bench and improved defense has kept the Raptors in the hunt at the top of the East.\n\n4. **Oklahoma City Thunder** - Oklahoma City is showing why Sam Presti should be considered the best GM in the game. The insane amount of talent assembled, historically good defense, and MVPWestbrook is finally clicking. Truly a team to be scared of.\n\n5. **Cleveland Cavaliers** - Don't look now, but The Land is 3rd in the East and have been struggling defensively as of late. Isaiah Thomas' return is going to help them. A lot.\n\n6. **Minnesota Timberwolves** - The Timberpups have assembled a winning squad behind the likes of Jimmy Butler and Tom Thibodeau, arguably the best defensive coaching mind in the league. They look very strong offensively as well.\n\n7. **Boston Celtics** - Brilliance from Brad Stevens continues to keep the Celtics afloat atop the East. Their once vaunted defense has slipped, but Kyrie Irving has shown why he is a top 3 MVP candidate once again. \n\n8. **Milwaukee Bucks** - Giannis has been a monster and despite the coaching incompetencies of Jason Kidd, the addition of Eric Bledsoe has given them a fearsome 1-2 punch to compete with anyone in the league.\n\n9. **Washington Wizards** - With the return of John Wall, people are going to start seeing just how good the Wizards are again. You can't underestimate the power of their backcourt and their ability to play up to their competition.\n\n10. **Portland Trail Blazers** - Even with their recent struggles, with Dame out, CJ has carried the workload. The Blazers much improved defense means they can keep up with any team. Look for a midseason trade to try to push them into that top 5-ish category.\n\n11. **San Antonio Spurs** - San Antonio has kept pace in the tough Western Conference, but signs of their age are showing and they are beginning to slow down. Can they truly compete against the elite teams in this league? Only time will tell.\n\n12. **Detroit Pistons** - The Detroit Pistons suffered a huge blow at the hands of Reggie Jackson's ankle, but they should be OK in a parity-driven Eastern Conference, and an elite coach in SVG and an elite center in 'Dre Drummond.\n\n13. **Indiana Pacers** - Don't look now, but Victor Oladipo is making a case for a top 15 player in this league. He's an elite scorer, playmaker, and the driving force behind Indiana's resurgence.\n\n14. **New Orleans Pelicans** - The Boogie Cousins AD frontcourt has so much potential, but maybe Alvin Gentry isn't the coach to tap into all that. Only time will tell if Rajon Rondo can elevate this team enough to be successful in the playoffs.\n\n15. **Denver Nuggets** - Although they have managed to stay afloat without Paul Millsap, we know they can't truly compete against the elite teams in this league without him. Regardless, the Joker has been truly fantastic and their young backcourt has shown signs of talent and promise. \n\n16. **Miami Heat** - A group of no-names led by Erik Spoelstra doing it again? No coach in the league is better at making the most of lesser talent. Spo has kept the Heat afloat without Whiteside. With him back in the fold, they should be even more deadly as they push for a playoff spot.\n\n17. **Chicago Bulls** - A huge jump up from the bottom of the scrap heap for the Chicago Bulls. Niko \"Threekola\" Mirotic has shown why he can be a legit stretch 4 in this league and Fred Hoiberg's motion offense is quite successful. No Tankcic for Doncic.\n\n18. **Los Angeles Clippers** - With Blake Griffin now available again, and Milos Teodosic back, the Clippers should contend for that 8th spot in the West. Blake can show once again why he is a bona fide top 10 player in this league.\n\n19. **Utah Jazz** - Even without Rudy Gobert, the Jazz have found a way. Credit Quin Snyder, who manages to turn Donovan Mitchell and Alec Burks into a solid offense with fundamentally good defense. Can't count them out of the 8th seed race yet.\n\n20. **New York Knicks** - Porzingod is quite good, but the rest of this roster is quite not up to par. Jeff Hornacek hasn't been the coach New Yorkers have wanted and their road struggles are the sign of a team that is about to fall apart.\n\n21. **Philadelphia 76ers** - Joel Embiid and ROTY Ben Simmons are excellent  but the 76ers still have growing pains as a young team. Look for them to get better as the season goes on with experience, but they still have a ways to go before being a truly legit contender of any sorts.\n\n22. **Charlotte Hornets** - Kemba Walker has been a truly All-Star caliber player, but the rest of this team has not been great. Dwight Howard continues to be puzzlingly good at times, but pleasantly awful at others.\n\n23. **Phoenix Suns** - Rise of the Devin Booker. That's what's going on in the dry desert valley, where this young squad struggles to play defense but is continuing to develop. Still, they have a ways to go before being higher on this list.\n\n24. **Brooklyn Nets** - The Nets manage to build on the front of culture but not on the front of the Wins column. They are nonetheless a young team with plenty of room for improvement, and should continue to do so as the season goes on.\n\n25. **Sacramento Kings** - The Vets and Z Bo are playing well, but the rookies are struggling a bit. Bo can only do so much to elevate what looks to be a bottom dwelling team for the rest of the season.\n\n26. **Dallas Mavericks** - Dirk has not been his old self, but still sells out the stadium. That, and DSJ is all Mavs fans can hope for as they continue to Tankcic for Doncic.\n\n27. **Orlando Magic** - The Magic have been unpleasantly awful after a great start to this year. They have room for growth, but Frank Vogel might be on the hot seat and their directionless nature is surfacing again.\n\n28. **Atlanta Hawks** - The Hawks are doing a great job retooling while remaining competitive. Nothing more to see here.\n\n29. **Los Angeles Lakers** - That Ball Boy has not been great, but the Kuz and the rest of the squad have been passably OK. Still, locker room tensions in a rebuilding team are not a recipe for success.\n\n30. **Memphis Grizzlies** - The Grizzlies have been bad. Awful.

Only time will tell.\n\n12. **Detroit Pistons** - The Detroit Pistons suffered a huge blow at the hands of Reggie Jackson's ankle, but they should be OK in a parity-driven Eastern Conference, and an elite coach in SVG and an elite center in 'Dre Drummond.\n\n13. **Indiana Pacers** - Don't look now, but Victor Oladipo is making a case for a top 15 player in this league. He's an elite scorer, playmaker, and the driving force behind Indiana's resurgence.\n\n14. **New Orleans Pelicans** - The Boogie Cousins AD frontcourt has so much potential, but maybe Alvin Gentry isn't the coach to tap into all that. Only time will tell if Rajon Rondo can elevate this team enough to be successful in the playoffs.\n\n15. **Denver Nuggets** - Although they have managed to stay afloat without Paul Millsap, we know they can't truly compete against the elite teams in this league without him. Regardless, the Joker has been truly fantastic and their young backcourt has shown signs of talent and promise. \n\n16. **Miami Heat** - A group of no-names led by Erik Spoelstra doing it again? No coach in the league is better at making the most of lesser talent. Spo has kept the Heat afloat without Whiteside. With him back in the fold, they should be even more deadly as they push for a playoff spot.\n\n17. **Chicago Bulls** - A huge jump up from the bottom of the scrap heap for the Chicago Bulls. Niko \"Threekola\" Mirotic has shown why he can be a legit stretch 4 in this league and Fred Hoiberg's motion offense is quite successful. No Tankcic for Doncic.\n\n18. **Los Angeles Clippers** - With Blake Griffin now available again, and Milos Teodosic back, the Clippers should contend for that 8th spot in the West. Blake can show once again why he is a bona fide top 10 player in this league.\n\n19. **Utah Jazz** - Even without Rudy Gobert, the Jazz have found a way. Credit Quin Snyder, who manages to turn Donovan Mitchell and Alec Burks into a solid offense with fundamentally good defense. Can't count them out of the 8th seed race yet.\n\n20. **New York Knicks** - Porzingod is quite good, but the rest of this roster is quite not up to par. Jeff Hornacek hasn't been the coach New Yorkers have wanted and their road struggles are the sign of a team that is about to fall apart.\n\n21. **Philadelphia 76ers** - Joel Embiid and ROTY Ben Simmons are excellent  but the 76ers still have growing pains as a young team. Look for them to get better as the season goes on with experience, but they still have a ways to go before being a truly legit contender of any sorts.\n\n22. **Charlotte Hornets** - Kemba Walker has been a truly All-Star caliber player, but the rest of this team has not been great. Dwight Howard continues to be puzzlingly good at times, but pleasantly awful at others.\n\n23. **Phoenix Suns** - Rise of the Devin Booker. That's what's going on in the dry desert valley, where this young squad struggles to play defense but is continuing to develop. Still, they have a ways to go before being higher on this list.\n\n24. **Brooklyn Nets** - The Nets manage to build on the front of culture but not on the front of the Wins column. They are nonetheless a young team with plenty of room for improvement, and should continue to do so as the season goes on.\n\n25. **Sacramento Kings** - The Vets and Z Bo are playing well, but the rookies are struggling a bit. Bo can only do so much to elevate what looks to be a bottom dwelling team for the rest of the season.\n\n26. **Dallas Mavericks** - Dirk has not been his old self, but still sells out the stadium. That, and DSJ is all Mavs fans can hope for as they continue to Tankcic for Doncic.\n\n27. **Orlando Magic** - The Magic have been unpleasantly awful after a great start to this year. They have room for growth, but Frank Vogel might be on the hot seat and their directionless nature is surfacing again.\n\n28. **Atlanta Hawks** - The Hawks are doing a great job retooling while remaining competitive. Nothing more to see here.\n\n29. **Los Angeles Lakers** - That Ball Boy has not been great, but the Kuz and the rest of the squad have been passably OK. Still, locker room tensions in a rebuilding team are not a recipe for success.\n\n30. **Memphis Grizzlies** - The Grizzlies have been bad. Awful. Mike Conley can't come back soon enough."}, {"id": "dryubzq", "body": "&gt; San Antonio Spurs - San Antonio has kept pace in the tough Western Conference, but signs of their age are showing and they are beginning to slow down.
