Over a shorter sample size such as this 1/3 of a season it isn't surprising to see them above some of these teams but over an entire season, it will take some extremely unfortunate luck from their competition in order to stay in the playoff hunt. \n\nMaybe I'll look like a fool for saying all that. But for now I am extremely confident the Bull's won't be a legitimate threat to make the playoffs."}, {"id": "dryde15", "body": "Just curious, have you actually watched the players Niko, Nwaba, Dunn have become? \n\nThe Bulls have s ton of depth, and they\u2019ve been giving a lot of teams issues with the fact that you either a) will not have their depth and will allow the Bulls to go on runs when you sit your talent; or b) you play your shortened lineup but then get worn down by the fact that the bulls play with the 2nd fastest pace in the league now and since none of their players play 30 minutes they are all gonna be fresher than you, and thus they\u2019ll go on some runs. \n\nRight now the Bulls have had the 2nd fastest pace, the 2nd best defensive rating. https://stats.nba.com/teams/defense/?LastNGames=12&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;dir=-1&amp;sort=DEF_RATING \n\nThey have two 7 footers who can hit from 3, play in the post, and take a player off the bounce. They\u2019re going to be adding one of the most explosive offensive prospects in the league. Hoiberg has literally had the team running the offense for LaVine all season, with holiday losing the team some games because he\u2019s not actually good enough to play LaVine\u2019s role at an elite level. \n\nNot saying the Bulls are definitely gonna go 27-19 and be .500, but your comment basically pretends there\u2019s no explanation for the Bulls winning 10/12 with the only losses coming to the Celtics and Cavs, all while they\u2019re most established player is out.
