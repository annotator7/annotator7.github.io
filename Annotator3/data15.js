Rain trickles down the glass slopes of Harden's mansion. Perhaps it's a symbol of his pain- they are window panes, after all- or perhaps it's just precipitation. Irrelevant.

A single tear falls in unison with the pouring rain.\n\nThe tear trickles down his cheek, gently running over his chocolate skin with the benevolent care of the hottest-chested nurse. It smoothly pours into Harden's world-beating beard, renowned and adored by NBA fans worldwide. Had anybody been there to witness it, they themselves would have cried directly into the beard of Harden as well.\n\nBut what happened when Harden fell asleep that night? Do you think that he slept like a normal person? Fuck no. The guy was just traded. Surprisingly, though, he slept well. Perhaps better than he ever had. The clock strikes 3 AM, making no sound because it is a digital clock and an alarm is not set. But that's irrelevant too.\n\nJames is encapsulated in a dream. He sits atop a snowy mountaintop, completely nude. It's not sexual, mind you, it simply reflects his newfound sense of isolation and feelings of vulnerability. He places his head down and cries quietly, snowflakes settling gently on his lightly tattooed breast. Again, a tear trickles down into his beard. \n\nHarden looks up with bloodshot eyes, wondering how he will continue on without his counterparts in Oklahoma City. Suddenly, he makes out a figure. It's indistinct, a shadowy presence of sorts that stands before him on the peak. It begins to speak.\n\n\"James, stand up.\" He stands up. \"I understand an occurrence of great negative magnitude precipitated ere the eve of the previous night. It's a tragedy, really. An injustice of no bounds. You see, I'm Seattle born-and-raised. That team was my livelihood. The bane of my existence. Then it got ripped away from me- James, I'm here to help you get revenge. Don't freak the fuck out.\"\n\nThe shadowy figure extends an arm towards Harden, reaching for his beard. The shadow suddenly slips and falls- it's snowing outside- and his hand instead wallops into Harden's dick. It caresses the ungodly bounds of Harden's downstairs forest, seemingly enchanting it with a cascade of mystical woodland nymphs. It begins to glow.\n\n\"James, you're blessed now. Enchanted. Every game, every night when you see those fans cheering for you from the stands, your pants beard will glow with heavenly bioluminescence. It will grant you mystical powers, you will draw contact at will, shoot at will, and you will attract former Los Angeles players for absolutely no reason.\" \n\n\"Also, you have chlamydia now. It only stops itching when you eurostep lmao\"\n\nAnd for the next five years, Harden shot and eurostepped his way to unequivocal stardom, fighting a courageous battle with chlamydia along the way.

Prokhorov had a mandate to spend lavishly and even promised to resign if Russia didn\u2019t win at least two gold medals on its home turf. He acknowledged that his sport had been tainted by doping scandals, and international biathlon officials publicly credited Prokhorov in the run-up to the Olympics for his anti-doping crackdown.\n\nBut on the night of Jan. 28, 2014, less than two weeks before Sochi\u2019s opening ceremony, Rodchenkov says he received an ominous call from Alexander Kravtsov, the head of Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation. He informed Rodchenkov that biathletes Ekaterina Iourieva and Irina Starykh had been disqualified by the sport\u2019s governing body after failing a doping test.\n\n\u201cThis was a disaster so close to the Sochi Games,\u201d Rodchenkov wrote in the affidavit.\n\nThe next day, Rodchenkov says he spoke with Irina Rodionova, the doctor who allegedly delivered the now-infamous steroid cocktail to Russian athletes and helped them replace contaminated samples with clean urine that would help them pass anti-doping tests.\n\nShe asked whether it was possible to \u201cdiscredit the analysis,\u201d Rodchenkov said. But since Iourieva and Starykh had been caught in Austria, he explained, there was nothing Rodchenkov could do to cast doubt on the results.\n\nThat\u2019s when Prokhorov got involved, Rodchenkov said.\n\nRodchenkov says Rodionova later told him that Starykh was planning to reveal her doping regimen as orchestrated by Stanislav \u201cStasik\u201d Dmietriev. Rodchenkov identifies him as a valuable source of Erythropoietin, otherwise known as EPO, providing Russian athletes with a form of the performance-enhancing drug that doping tests struggled to detect.\n\nStarykh never went public with her first-hand knowledge of Russia\u2019s doping scheme.

Prokhorov himself criticized Rodchenkov when the IOC slapped lifetime bans last month on two other Russian biathletes who medaled in Sochi and said he would offer financial support if they took legal action.\n\nKonstantin Boitsov, a spokesman for Russia\u2019s biathlon federation, also disputed Rodchenkov\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cIf it happened, no one knew about it,\u201d he said. \u201cMikhail Prokhorov was an important businessman who was more interested in the finances of the federation as well as his other projects, and didn\u2019t have much contact with athletes outside of formal ceremonies.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the NBA declined to comment on the allegations.\n\nProkhorov sold a 49% stake in his team earlier this year to Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai, and included an option for Tsai to purchase the controlling share from Prokhorov in four years. Prokhorov stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the investment even though the Nets have been one of the league\u2019s worst teams under his ownership. The sale valued the Nets at $2.3 billion less than a decade after Prokhorov bought his 80% stake and parts of the new downtown Brooklyn arena and surrounding real estate for $260 million.\n\nProkhorov made a defiant promise back then that might have sounded familiar to Russian biathlon fans. If the Nets didn\u2019t win a championship in the next five years, he said, Prokhorov vowed to punish himself with the worst penalty he could imagine: marriage.
