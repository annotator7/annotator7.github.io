I was wondering what the number was, since from the eye-test it looked like he almost never missed. Then I found [this](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/936326967686819841). CP3 is a magician with the basketball; He finds Ryno open on the opposite side of the court many times, and few players can deliver the ball as accurately as he can across the court with consistency (only Harden and LeBron come to mind for me). Here are some examples of him hitting Ryno wide open with a clean, crisp pass:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/r9v3h)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/dfv4p)\n* [Example 3] ( https://streamable.com/1phle) \n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/rh30p)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/8gw3b)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/k16hf)\n* [Example 7] ( https://streamable.com/fz8cb) \n* [Example 8] (https://streamable.com/u1kvk)\n* [Example 9] (https://streamable.com/h4gtz)\n* [Example 10] (https://streamable.com/5udsf)\n\nTurns out, not only is Ryno shooting absurdly well, the Rockets as a TEAM are shooting a combined 50% off Paul's passes. If you take into account that the 2nd best marksman on the team and current 3pt shooting champ, Eric Gordon, is a combined 8/44 (an abysmal 18.1%) in the 6 games hes played with CP3, then its even more amazing. CP3 routinely finds teammates open with passes like the following:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/oa1ra)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/08jw8)\n* [Example 3] (https://streamable.com/cjlnv)\n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/636dt)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/kf09z)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/dkana)\n\n\nSo this leads to two pretty serious questions: Was it a blessing in disguise to keep Ryno and not get Melo? Is CP3 currently severely underrated in today's game? \n\nIn my opinion, Ryan Anderson has greatly benefited from the increased spacing and vision provided by CP3, and this has made him more valuable. The better shooting, improved defense (last year he was just garbo defending inside), and increased dimension that Ryno brings to the offense are reasons in my opinion why he is a better fit than Melo for this current Rockets team. However, we will see what happens for the remainder of the season with both Ryno and Melo. \n\nWith regards to CP3, he is actually so underrated on offense, because of his ability to deliver passes with perfect timing and accurancy. Perfectly placing the basketball in his shooters' shooting pockets is an actual skill and doing it routinely is impressive. Combine this with his low turnover rate (72 assists/9 turnovers on the season), and amazing defense (14 steals in 7 games this year), and poise/ability to run a offense and you have reasons why he is still a top-10 player in the league, in my opinion. While compiling these 3pt highlights, I watched lots of video of CP3 routinely threading the needle or making bounce passes with crazy spin like it was nothing to find open Rockets inside the 3 point line, and I realized just how nasty of a passer CP3 is.\n\n---\nTL;DR CP3 is a point god and Ryno is a beast.

Here are some examples of him hitting Ryno wide open with a clean, crisp pass:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/r9v3h)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/dfv4p)\n* [Example 3] ( https://streamable.com/1phle) \n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/rh30p)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/8gw3b)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/k16hf)\n* [Example 7] ( https://streamable.com/fz8cb) \n* [Example 8] (https://streamable.com/u1kvk)\n* [Example 9] (https://streamable.com/h4gtz)\n* [Example 10] (https://streamable.com/5udsf)\n\nTurns out, not only is Ryno shooting absurdly well, the Rockets as a TEAM are shooting a combined 50% off Paul's passes. If you take into account that the 2nd best marksman on the team and current 3pt shooting champ, Eric Gordon, is a combined 8/44 (an abysmal 18.1%) in the 6 games hes played with CP3, then its even more amazing. CP3 routinely finds teammates open with passes like the following:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/oa1ra)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/08jw8)\n* [Example 3] (https://streamable.com/cjlnv)\n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/636dt)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/kf09z)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/dkana)\n\n\nSo this leads to two pretty serious questions: Was it a blessing in disguise to keep Ryno and not get Melo? Is CP3 currently severely underrated in today's game? \n\nIn my opinion, Ryan Anderson has greatly benefited from the increased spacing and vision provided by CP3, and this has made him more valuable. The better shooting, improved defense (last year he was just garbo defending inside), and increased dimension that Ryno brings to the offense are reasons in my opinion why he is a better fit than Melo for this current Rockets team. However, we will see what happens for the remainder of the season with both Ryno and Melo. \n\nWith regards to CP3, he is actually so underrated on offense, because of his ability to deliver passes with perfect timing and accurancy. Perfectly placing the basketball in his shooters' shooting pockets is an actual skill and doing it routinely is impressive. Combine this with his low turnover rate (72 assists/9 turnovers on the season), and amazing defense (14 steals in 7 games this year), and poise/ability to run a offense and you have reasons why he is still a top-10 player in the league, in my opinion. While compiling these 3pt highlights, I watched lots of video of CP3 routinely threading the needle or making bounce passes with crazy spin like it was nothing to find open Rockets inside the 3 point line, and I realized just how nasty of a passer CP3 is.\n\n---\nTL;DR CP3 is a point god and Ryno is a beast.

While compiling these 3pt highlights, I watched lots of video of CP3 routinely threading the needle or making bounce passes with crazy spin like it was nothing to find open Rockets inside the 3 point line, and I realized just how nasty of a passer CP3 is.\n\n---\nTL;DR CP3 is a point god and Ryno is a beast.

I was wondering what the number was, since from the eye-test it looked like he almost never missed. Then I found [this](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/936326967686819841). CP3 is a magician with the basketball; He finds Ryno open on the opposite side of the court many times, and few players can deliver the ball as accurately as he can across the court with consistency (only Harden and LeBron come to mind for me). Here are some examples of him hitting Ryno wide open with a clean, crisp pass:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/r9v3h)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/dfv4p)\n* [Example 3] ( https://streamable.com/1phle) \n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/rh30p)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/8gw3b)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/k16hf)\n* [Example 7] ( https://streamable.com/fz8cb) \n* [Example 8] (https://streamable.com/u1kvk)\n* [Example 9] (https://streamable.com/h4gtz)\n* [Example 10] (https://streamable.com/5udsf)\n\nTurns out, not only is Ryno shooting absurdly well, the Rockets as a TEAM are shooting a combined 50% off Paul's passes. If you take into account that the 2nd best marksman on the team and current 3pt shooting champ, Eric Gordon, is a combined 8/44 (an abysmal 18.1%) in the 6 games hes played with CP3, then its even more amazing. CP3 routinely finds teammates open with passes like the following:\n\n* [Example 1] (https://streamable.com/oa1ra)\n* [Example 2] (https://streamable.com/08jw8)\n* [Example 3] (https://streamable.com/cjlnv)\n* [Example 4] (https://streamable.com/636dt)\n* [Example 5] (https://streamable.com/kf09z)\n* [Example 6] (https://streamable.com/dkana)\n\n\nSo this leads to two pretty serious questions: Was it a blessing in disguise to keep Ryno and not get Melo? Is CP3 currently severely underrated in today's game? \n\nIn my opinion, Ryan Anderson has greatly benefited from the increased spacing and vision provided by CP3, and this has made him more valuable. The better shooting, improved defense (last year he was just garbo defending inside), and increased dimension that Ryno brings to the offense are reasons in my opinion why he is a better fit than Melo for this current Rockets team. However, we will see what happens for the remainder of the season with both Ryno and Melo. \n\nWith regards to CP3, he is actually so underrated on offense, because of his ability to deliver passes with perfect timing and accurancy.
