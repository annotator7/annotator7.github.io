With no proven pieces besides Schroder that will allow for success right away, Lebron has no reasoning to join the ATL. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be? The Celtics appear set on the wing with Brown, Tatum and Hayward for the foreseeable future and a Kyrie-Lebron reunion won\u2019t exactly resemble Jon Snow and Sansa at Castle Black. As the main threat to Lebron in the east, the Celtics are in a great position in regards to assets that can potentially bring in another star player down the road, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lebron would be one of them. The Celtics appear comfortable with the nucleus they have, particularly with the very young wings that have shown great potential so far. Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season. Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town. While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly.

With no proven pieces besides Schroder that will allow for success right away, Lebron has no reasoning to join the ATL. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be? The Celtics appear set on the wing with Brown, Tatum and Hayward for the foreseeable future and a Kyrie-Lebron reunion won\u2019t exactly resemble Jon Snow and Sansa at Castle Black. As the main threat to Lebron in the east, the Celtics are in a great position in regards to assets that can potentially bring in another star player down the road, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lebron would be one of them. The Celtics appear comfortable with the nucleus they have, particularly with the very young wings that have shown great potential so far. Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season. Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town. While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career.

One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility.

Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here.

Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season. Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town. While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly.

Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be?

Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town. While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly. The most likely dark horse is the Lakers (whom on face value are far behind the other candidates)"}, {"id": "dr3fo1i", "body": "Awesome write up.

With no proven pieces besides Schroder that will allow for success right away, Lebron has no reasoning to join the ATL. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be? The Celtics appear set on the wing with Brown, Tatum and Hayward for the foreseeable future and a Kyrie-Lebron reunion won\u2019t exactly resemble Jon Snow and Sansa at Castle Black. As the main threat to Lebron in the east, the Celtics are in a great position in regards to assets that can potentially bring in another star player down the road, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lebron would be one of them. The Celtics appear comfortable with the nucleus they have, particularly with the very young wings that have shown great potential so far. Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season.

While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly. The most likely dark horse is the Lakers (whom on face value are far behind the other candidates)"}, {"id": "dr3fw26", "body": "I'll probably get downvoted, but I just don't see the Philly option.

With no proven pieces besides Schroder that will allow for success right away, Lebron has no reasoning to join the ATL. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be? The Celtics appear set on the wing with Brown, Tatum and Hayward for the foreseeable future and a Kyrie-Lebron reunion won\u2019t exactly resemble Jon Snow and Sansa at Castle Black. As the main threat to Lebron in the east, the Celtics are in a great position in regards to assets that can potentially bring in another star player down the road, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lebron would be one of them. The Celtics appear comfortable with the nucleus they have, particularly with the very young wings that have shown great potential so far. Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season. Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town.

The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly. The most likely dark horse is the Lakers (whom on face value are far behind the other candidates)"}, {"id": "dr3jt01", "body": "418 pels fans\n\nLol"}, {"id": "dr3jt01", "body": "418 pels fans\n\nLol"}, {"id": "dr3rmsr", "body": "there's actually 658"}, {"id": "dr3rmsr", "body": "there's actually 658"}, {"id": "dr48yqy", "body": "Wow!"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7j3m2t", "body": "Atlanta Hawks: Don\u2019t be fooled by the constant reminders that \u2018the Atlanta Hawks are not rebuilding\u2019 because this young team is transitioning to a different direction. With no proven pieces besides Schroder that will allow for success right away, Lebron has no reasoning to join the ATL. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBrooklyn Nets: No longer the bottom feeders of the league, the Nets have some reason to be hopeful with a well coached young team that plays hard. While this is a marked improvement for the organisation, it\u2019s not enough to lure away Lebron just based on year to year progress for a non-playoff team. Verdict- Not happening\n\nBoston Celtics: Could you imagine how awkward this would be? The Celtics appear set on the wing with Brown, Tatum and Hayward for the foreseeable future and a Kyrie-Lebron reunion won\u2019t exactly resemble Jon Snow and Sansa at Castle Black. As the main threat to Lebron in the east, the Celtics are in a great position in regards to assets that can potentially bring in another star player down the road, but it\u2019s doubtful that Lebron would be one of them. The Celtics appear comfortable with the nucleus they have, particularly with the very young wings that have shown great potential so far. Verdict- \u201cIt\u2019s either me or him\u201d-Kyrie Irving probably. Unlikely.\n\nCharlotte Hornets: Unless Lebron has a lifelong dream to work for his childhood idol Michael Jordan, the Hornets haven\u2019t shown the success nor the upside that would pose as an appealing destination for Lebron. The hornets cycle of mediocrity isn\u2019t conducive for the team to be a good looking potential free agent location for any good player, much less Lebron. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nChicago Bulls: Yeah Right. Verdict- At least you have Lauri and cash considerations\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: The most likely scenario is Lebron staying home yet one which depends largely on the performance of the team in the playoffs/finals. Despite of the hometown advantages the Cavs have, the roster has begun to resemble the 2013-14 Heat which relied heavily on older players whom fell apart as the season progressed so Lebron staying is far from guaranteed. But Lebron will always be the kid from Akron. Verdict- Favourites\n\nDallas Mavericks: Could Mark Cuban\u2019s seemingly never ending quest to get Dirk a costar be complete? After a decade plus of playoff appearances the Mavs are in a rebuilding phase, with Dirk acting as the bridge between the eras. With no appeal to Lebron to offset the reality that this team isn\u2019t good enough to compete, there\u2019s really no case to be made here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nDenver Nuggets: The Nuggets have intriguing young talent and in a way resembles the Cavs team that Lebron committed to joining in 2014. The major differences here however is that Lebron won\u2019t be 29 this offseason and Denver has no sentimental value for him. If he wanted to join a young promising team there are better options out there. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nDetroit Pistons: After starting hot this season, the Pistons have seemingly cooled. While there is undeniable playoff capability for this team, there isn\u2019t another player alongside Lebron who could reduce his role offensively to the degree that he\u2019ll need and desire as he enters the later years of his career. While this team has potential to be good, Lebron will be seeking a team with potential to be great. Verdict- Not happening \n\nGolden State Warriors: So who\u2019s ready for the next lockout? Perhaps the most unfathomable event in NBA history would be Lebron signing with the Warriors, with likely consequences including protest from the 29 other owners, calls for free agency reform and probably subsequent legal ramifications. The resulting shitstorm would take r/nba to the upside down. Logistically this would be difficult for even the Warriors front office to pull off barring a significant paycut by Lebron or KD. Verdict- Highly Unlikely (thank God)\n\nHouston Rockets: The sexy pick, with current MVP favourites Lebron and Harden teaming up with (potentially) Chris Paul to form the most dynamic playmaking trio ever seen in the NBA.  The Ryan Anderson contract still stand in the way although an agreement by Lebron would surely lead to a cap clearing move as recent NBA history has shown.  This may be the most fun hypothetical either way, with D\u2019Antoni ball mixing with the move of Lebron to a more offball role that he has never played leading to an entertaining idea of what the team would be like. Verdict- True Contender \n\nIndiana Pacers: After trading away the rare Indiana superstar player, the pacers have surprised this season, led by The emerged Victor Oladipo who is having an all star caliber season. Unfortunately for this young Indiana team, the Pacers suffer from the same shortcomings that the pistons do. For that reason it\u2019s hard to imagine Lebron in the yellow, blue and white. Verdict- Not happening\n\nLA Clippers: With the Banana Boat connection with Chris Paul gone and the team is in flux, spearheaded by often injured Blake Griffin, trade candidate Deandre Jordan and underachieving Doc Rivers.  This team was good enough for Kevin Durant to take a meeting with them in 2016 but those days seem like an eternity ago. The only case for Lebron to join the sailboats is based on location, not much at all for someone still eager to contend. Verdict- Maybe a dark horse two years ago but not in 2018. Not happening.\n\nLA Lakers: Here we go again. If it feels like D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu then that\u2019s because it is. Similarly to the rumours that persisted in 2013-14, the Lakers are pegged as potential suitors for Lebron. Of the teams deemed a destination, the Lakers have by far the largest question mark. Entering free agency at the age of 33 in July, this would require an addition of another superstar player (Paul George or Demarcus Cousins?) at least to make the Lakers viable enough as a win now team. Lebron\u2019s residence in LA is a sign of hope, but too many things must fall in line for this to be for seen as a true possibility at the moment. Verdict- Possible but don\u2019t bet on it\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: The grizzlies appear to be nearing the end of their run led by Gasol and Conley. While it would be poetic for the grizzlies to get Lebron after they were so close to drafting him in 2003, there\u2019s nothing intriguing about this team that peaked years ago. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nMiami Heat: \u2018I\u2019m Coming (to my other) Home Part 2\u2019 by Lee Jenkins and Lebron James. With movable assets, Pat Riley has kept this team flexible with an abundance of middling contracts and players. The terms of Lebron\u2019s departure wasn\u2019t exactly the smoothest however and the sentimental value is all but gone, with unofficial player-coach Udonis Haslem being the only player left from the Big 3 era. Verdict- Time to retire that #6 jersey soon because he\u2019s not coming back.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks: Asking Lebron to join the Bucks is basically asking him if he wants to play with Giannis. As great as the Greek Freak has been, there is no distinct third star that can be counted upon to play toe to toe with the Warriors whom Lebron must go through. Perhaps if Jabari had not suffered his acl injuries, the Bucks would be further along in their development as a team but this current iteration doesn\u2019t have enough beyond Giannis. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s hard to see it happening.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves: If only the Wolves were in the east then one would think they would be a greater contender in Lebron\u2019s free agency. With a talented young nucleus, the Timberwolves provide an intriguing yet incomplete destination for Lebron and other potential free agents (provided they\u2019d be willing to take a paycut and live in Minnesota). It\u2019s hard to envision Lebron in a wolves uniform and the lustre of the up and coming team has been seemingly overshadowed by another team better suited for him out east (see Philly). Verdict- Unlikely but not completely impossible to envision.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans: A Cousins-Davis-Lebron trio may contend for the greatest on paper frontcourt of all time. Unfortunately for the 218 Pelicans fans, the team has too many question marks headed forward. It is not out of the question that Cousins may not be in New Orleans by June and the numerous albatross contracts has handcuffed any potential ability to upgrade this roster. One has to wonder how much longer Davis will tolerate being on a team repeatedly hamstrung by its front office. The stability just isn\u2019t there for Lebron. Verdict- Would be fun but it\u2019s not happening.\n\nNew York Knicks: The possibility of Lebron joining the Knicks predicates entirely on the idea that the experience of playing in New York is what he desires in this scenario because this young team is far from a contender. After they struck out with Lebron in 2010, I wouldn\u2019t get my hopes up eight years later. Verdict- Unlikely\n\nOKC Thunder: A difficult estimation here with the possibility that both Paul George and Carmelo Anthony may not be on the team next year. Underachieving this season, the fit of Westbrook and the new additions has been suspect with a thin bench compounding on the already present issues. All in all, it\u2019s hard to imagine King James riding his Kia through Oklahoma City next year. Verdict- Unlikely.\n\nOrlando Magic: The Magic\u2019s hot start gave them their first sense of real hope since Dwight Howard (eventually) left town. While Aaron Gordon is nice, there\u2019s no reality in which Lebron joins a team like the Magic. Verdict- Not happening \n\nPhiladelphia 76ers: As he heads into his 16th season, if Lebron wants a team with young athletes and creators that can ease his workload while allowing him to stay in the east, the Sixers are his best option. A competitive team with tremendous upside, the Sixers team would provide Lebron with a potential juggernaut of young stars that he could lead and later defer to as his role shrinks as he ages. While the fit of Lebron-Simmons-Embiid may be weird, there\u2019s simply too much talent here to ignore the possibility. Verdict- Contender\n\nPhoenix Suns: Is Devin Booker and Josh Jackson enough to convince Lebron to join the suns? The answer is No. Verdict- Not happening\n\nPortland Trailblazers: Another possibility that is more fun than it is realistic, Lebron on the Blazers with Lillard, McCollum and Nurkic makes for an intriguing squad. Out west however this is by no means a favourite nor would it bring Lebron any closer to a championship. Verdict- Unlikely unless Lebron wants to be near the Nike compound for whatever reason.\n\nSacramento Kings: The King on the Kings? Don\u2019t get too excited. Verdict- Not happening.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: Lebron\u2019s professed admiration for Gregg Popovich cuts both ways with this possibility, with Chris Paul\u2019s reported hesitation to sign with San Antonio largely attributed to the likelihood of the 68 year old coaching legend probably nearing the end of his career. One would assume that Pop would delay retirement at the guarantee of coaching Lebron however that is purely conjecture at this point. A tandem of Lebron and Kawhi would complement one another, although there seems to be something missing in this possibility. Verdict- Contender as you can never underestimate the Spurs magic.\n\nToronto Raptors: If you\u2019ve ever wondered what it would be like to see Lebron play with his kids then this is the closest we\u2019ll get until Bronny Jr. makes the league. Lebron has defeated the raptors in convincing fashion multiple times, seemingly not taking them seriously as competition in the east. While this team has talent, it\u2019s not substantial enough to provide Lebron what he doesn\u2019t already have in Cleveland. Verdict- Unlikely unless Drake knows something that we don\u2019t \n\nUtah Jazz: Well this would be the most unlikely good team destination for sure. This defensive minded team resembles to a degree many of the team Lebron was on in his first stint in Cleveland. At 33 years old in the offseason however, Lebron isn\u2019t looking for a challenge like how do I lead this Jazz team. There\u2019s just not enough here. Verdict- Not happening \n\nWashington Wizards: This tough wizards team has been competitive with the Cavs over the past couple of seasons and  the backcourt tandem of Wall and Beal would be the greatest collective backcourt Lebron has played with. Unfortunately this would be seen as a lateral move for Lebron, joining another eastern conference team with not a large upside. He might as well stay in Cleveland. Verdict- Not impossible but very unlikely.\n\nCONCLUSION: The true contenders it appears for Lebron are Cleveland, Houston, San Antonio and Philly.
