I only watched the highlights. But a 20-2 run, **ANY** 20-2 run, is extremely astonishing in an NBA game. To say that is merely a result of \"teams just smash terrible shots down the stretch\" is extremely questionable, especially if the same thing is happening on a recurring basis, but I repeat, I'm still shocked by your statement: \"we didn't play that bad this game.\"\n\nLast season I completely bought into the Westbrook triple-double / he had no help narrative. But the facts are extremely chilling and alarming for the Thunder this season. Look at the [projected standings](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20225286/projected-records-win-totals-standings-every-nba-team-2017-18-season) at the start of the season. \n\n5th in the Wild West, with an expected 49.5 wins.\n\nFor simplicity sake, let's round down instead of up, and say you'll be expected to reach 49 wins. \n\nYou are 12-14 right now. There are 56 games to go. For OKC to reach the pre-season prediction, they'll need to win 66% of their remaining games, or 2 out of every 3 games they play.\n\nYou can say I'm overreaching, you can say I'm overreacting, but winning 2/3 of your remaining games is no easy task for any team (Warriors excluded, possibly the Rockets as well with the way they've been playing this season), especially in the Wild West. But it's especially concerning for your team if you would look at this performance, a loss against a 13th placed Hornets team, and be able to say: \"We didn't play that bad this game\". \n\nBecause this type of performance shouldn't be winning you games. And even if you managed to win this game, this type of performance definitely won't be winning 66% of your remaining 56.
