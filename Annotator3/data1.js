It looks much cleaner than LBJ highlights which tend to lean on power, athleticism, unstoppable force. Kobe also made RIDICULOUS shots over defenders, in super clutch moments. He would make shots that you probably shouldn't take tbh because there were better plays. When they did go in it just seemed magical. The difficulty in shots he made was amazing.\n\nWhen you take a final shot, there's a reason you yell Kobe because that's who you want to emulate.
