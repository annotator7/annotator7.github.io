If you disagree with your teams pick please tell me why and who you would rather take instead as I only consistently watch one team. Standings taken from official NBA site on 12/22/17. \n\n**1. Atlanta Hawks (7-24)** \n\n[SG/PG Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ6GU4unGEg&amp;t=15s) \n\nThe best fit for the Hawks, given that they already have John Collins in their long term plans should be someone at the guard position. Doncic will compliment Schroeder well as another facilitator and can develop into an end of shot clock option down the road. His defensive contribution won't be his best feature in the NBA but he has played professionally in Spain for a few years and shouldn't be overlooked as a defender. At 6'8\" he is tall and an upgrade to Belinelli and Blazemore. Him and John Collins on the boards are a good recipe for success in the next 3 years. He is the best fit for the Hawks because he completes their backcourt and allows a bigger front court role for John Collins. \n\n**2. Memphis Grizzlies (9-23)** *1-2 record against Dallas so far*\n\n[PF Marvin Bagley III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIGP-3y3Qx4)\n\nClearly the best player in the draft class, he would fit great next to Gasol assuming he isn't traded. His offensive tools are next level and it's even more mind blowing considering he wasn't in this draft class until a year ago. He would slot in at the power forward and grab rebounds while the Grizz enjoy his above average mid range shooting and left block post moves. Bagley will improve offensive output of the Grizzlies and will probably have to adjust to the bigger bodies of the NBA but he should still rebound well. \n\n**3. Dallas Mavericks (9-23)** \n\n[C Deandre Ayton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j_fxbScQoc&amp;t=80s)\n\nThe Mavericks are sticking with Harrison Barnes at the 3/4 long term, and not committing to Nerlens Noel after he turned down their massive contract last year. Instead, they should look for a big man. The Arizona center looks to be developing an outside shot and over 7 feet tall. He would fit in well with this team and can develop a great pick and roll game with DSJ that would lead to lots of midrange shots or better lanes for DSJ. If he can develop into a rim protector as well then the Mavericks will have struck gold at the 3rd pick. \n\n**4. Chicago Bulls (10-21)**\n\n[SF Michael Porter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFcDqubVQxs)\n\nThis is a slightly risky pick currently with his back issues. However, with the emergence of the real KD and the Finnisher in the windy city, a small forward is their pick to solidify lineup of the future. With his ability *in high school* to get to the rim and finish above smaller defenders at 6'10\", he should be able to slash well in this offense. He has shown a proficient ability to shoot the three but has yet to appear in significant time at Missouri due to a back injury. Despite his questionable health currently, I think he is worth the gamble and will flourish with an increased role in Chicago. \n\n**5. Orlando Magic (11-21)**\n\n[C Mo Bamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y77tHIX-kEs)\n\nBamba is still pretty raw, but will have time to develop behind Vucci Mane in Orlando. With drafting Jonathon Isaac and long term contracts looming for both Payton and Aaron Gordon, a center makes sense here. Bamba has a massive 7'9\" wingspan and can develop into an elite rim protector. His offensive game leaves much to desire but he shouldn't be burdened with scoring in Orlando and his defense can be invaluable off the bench, at a much better price than Biyombo. Overall, this team is young and has room to grow, and Bamba should fit in well with little pressure to perform immediately in Orlando. \n\n**6. Charlotte Hornets (11-20)**\n\n[PG Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-pzOchpUM)\n\nTrae Young is a scoring guard with next level court vision to match. With the Hornets struggling to find both bench scoring and a suitable backup to Kemba Walker, this pick is a no brainer if he's still available. Kemba can teach the undersized guard the ways of finishing in the NBA, not like Young needs much guidance as he already exhibits the best floater in college basketball. He is deadly from three point and has shown big league range already. He scored 43 on Oregon and finished a game with 22 assists while also scoring 26 points already this season. \n\n**7. Sacramento Kings (11-20)**\n\n[PF/C Jaren Jackson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipnrqPO22A)\n\nThis was a tough decision, as the Kings already have WCS, Skal and Harry Giles at the forward spots. However, with Giles injury concerns and a lack of real frontrunner at the 4 and 5 for the kings, this pick feels good for them. Jackson has an unorthodox shot that may take some fixing, but he is a skilled rebounder, is athletic for his height and can rebound with the best of them. He can be a rim protector down the line and can potentially offer some scoring once Zach Randolph decides to hang em up. \n\n**8. Cleveland Cavaliers** *via Brooklyn Nets (11-19)*\n\n[SF Kevin Knox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RM4aj7CETk)\n\nThe Cavs should take best available with the Brooklyn pick and in my mind that would be Kevin Knox. He has serious length at 6'9\", incredible athletic ability that helps him finish around the rim and a good jumper. Assuming the Cavs hold on to Lebron, he will be an excellent addition off the bench for this team as he can create his own shot. Knox is also a good rebounder at the 3 and has length to play a small ball 4 off the bench. If Lebron does leave, Knox will either fill in and get increased minutes, or come off the bench and back up the replacement brought in. Either way, this is a win for both player and team as Knox should develop into a solid wing. \n\n**9. Philadelphia 76ers** *via Los Angeles Lakers (11-18)*\n\n[SG Mikal Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmukx6YJoHs)\n\nThis is one of my favorite players to watch in college basketball. He is a legit scoring threat who rebounds well in the college game. This guy is a shooter who can also score around the rim and will fit in perfectly for the Sixers. He is also a solid defender who is constantly working on the defensive end. All around, this pick is mostly due to the Sixers having their long term solutions at the forward slots in Covington, Simmons and Embiid. Additionally, a point guard doesn't make sense here as we still have yet to see a healthy Fultz take the offense and Saric being a solid compliment to Embiid. \n\n**10. Phoenix Suns (12-22)**\n\n[PG Colin Sexton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBUKjrMp_s)\n\nSexton is an absolute beast, he's got elite speed and good length to develop into a solid NBA guard. Sexton has already shown his ability to score, and score in bunches. Additionally, his speed should help him run exceptionally well in transition and have an easier time defending smaller guards in the NBA than Trae Young. In fact, with Devin Booker being a purely offensive talent at this point, I think this is a better fit than Trae Young for the Suns long-term. Additionally, with Josh Jackson showing similar athleticism and speed, Sexton would easily make the Suns my favorite team to watch. As bigs such as Dragan Bender and Alex Len are still looking to validate their status as lottery picks, I think a PG to replace Bledsoe is best at this spot given how many quality bigs were taken earlier. Additionally, the Suns hold the Heat pick three picks later, and shouldn't bank on Sexton being available then. \n\n**11. Los Angeles Clippers (12-18)**\n\n[Wendell Carter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBi61zvzhg)\n\nWith the prospect of losing DeAndre Jordan, this pick makes sense for the Clippers. The clippers have depth at Point Guard with Teodosic and Beverley as well as serviceable depth at the 2 with Rivers and potentially re-signing Lou Williams. However, Carter at 6'10\" would slot into Center better than Robert Williams would in this team. Additionally, Carter plays alongside a PF who can shoot the midrange currently in Bagley. This culminates in an appreciation for rebounding, and an ability to guard the rim which the Clippers would lose with the departure of Jordan. Carter has a lot of room to improve on the offensive end but will be solid for the Clippers in a limited offensive role while cleaning up the glass from Blake Griffin isolations.\n\n**12. Philadelphia 76ers (14-17)**\n\n[PG Trevon Duval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6Dy3WHyro)\n\nThis is a luxury pick for the 76ers and they would probably rather take Miles Bridges at this point instead of Duval. However, I would rather see Bridges go to the Jazz at 14 and Duval is a stash guy for when the Bayless contract runs out or Fultz doesn't pan out. Duval is athletic, has quick hands and the court vision that can help distribute the ball around an offense with multiple points of attack. Duval would be very valuable off the bench, which is where he will likely end up. Duval is quick and can beat his man off the dribble, he also had 6 steals in a game earlier this year. Duval is unselfish and relishes his role in the Duke offense as a facilitator, I would love to see him play with the Sixers bench unit. \n\n**13. Phoenix Suns** *via Miami Heat (16-15)*\n\n[SG Hamidou Diallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3vJHdZa7c)\n\nThis pick makes sense even if all I looked at was the school Diallo attends. Diallo would join a backcourt with Booker, Ulis and Brandon Knight, all former Kentucky Wildcats. The Suns desperately need a back up to Booker based upon my quick glance at a Depth Chart, and with the pick of Sexton just earlier, this pick should be spent on their bench. Diallo should be perfect here to play alongside Ulis in the back court and possesses length and athleticism to accompany his scoring ability. Diallo is expected to have huge upside, and will be given time to grow in the Suns organization. Given the previously discussed logjam at Forward positions for the Suns, a Shooting Guard makes the most sense with this pick.  \n\n**14. Utah Jazz (15-18)**\n\n[SF Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blxKm8kVGjQ&amp;t=2s)\n\nThis guy is an absolute monster, and likely will not be available at pick 14 if he leaves after this season. He is a freakish athlete and an absolute menace on the boards. Pairing him with a backcourt of Rubio and Mitchell would be ideal especially with Rudy Gobert and potentially re-signing Derrick Favors locking up the forward position for years. However, If Bridges weren't available for the Jazz at 14, Robert Williams would fill the void nicely at PF for Utah. Regardless, the Jazz are in a good place and Bridges would be an absolute animal backing up Joe Ingles. \n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n**Hawks:** Luke Doncic\n**Grizzlies:** Marvin Bagley III\n**Mavericks:** Deandre Ayton\n**Bulls:** Michael Porter Jr.\n**Magic:** Mo Bamba\n**Hornets:** Trae Young\n**Kings:** Jaren Jackson Jr.\n**Cavaliers:** Kevin Knox\n**76ers:** Mikal Bridges, Trevon Duval\n**Suns:** Collin Sexton, Hamidou Diallo\n**Clippers:** Wendell Carter Jr. \n**Jazz:** Miles Bridges\n\nedit: stuck to -&gt; sticking with harrison barnes under the Mavs pick."}, {"id": "drnl60h", "body": "Trae Young will be a Sun "}, {"id": "drnl60h", "body": "Trae Young will be a Sun "}, {"id": "drnmkbo", "body": "Suns need to keep losing and land into a top 3 pick.

He is a legit scoring threat who rebounds well in the college game. This guy is a shooter who can also score around the rim and will fit in perfectly for the Sixers. He is also a solid defender who is constantly working on the defensive end. All around, this pick is mostly due to the Sixers having their long term solutions at the forward slots in Covington, Simmons and Embiid. Additionally, a point guard doesn't make sense here as we still have yet to see a healthy Fultz take the offense and Saric being a solid compliment to Embiid. \n\n**10. Phoenix Suns (12-22)**\n\n[PG Colin Sexton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBUKjrMp_s)\n\nSexton is an absolute beast, he's got elite speed and good length to develop into a solid NBA guard. Sexton has already shown his ability to score, and score in bunches. Additionally, his speed should help him run exceptionally well in transition and have an easier time defending smaller guards in the NBA than Trae Young. In fact, with Devin Booker being a purely offensive talent at this point, I think this is a better fit than Trae Young for the Suns long-term. Additionally, with Josh Jackson showing similar athleticism and speed, Sexton would easily make the Suns my favorite team to watch. As bigs such as Dragan Bender and Alex Len are still looking to validate their status as lottery picks, I think a PG to replace Bledsoe is best at this spot given how many quality bigs were taken earlier. Additionally, the Suns hold the Heat pick three picks later, and shouldn't bank on Sexton being available then. \n\n**11. Los Angeles Clippers (12-18)**\n\n[Wendell Carter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBi61zvzhg)\n\nWith the prospect of losing DeAndre Jordan, this pick makes sense for the Clippers. The clippers have depth at Point Guard with Teodosic and Beverley as well as serviceable depth at the 2 with Rivers and potentially re-signing Lou Williams. However, Carter at 6'10\" would slot into Center better than Robert Williams would in this team. Additionally, Carter plays alongside a PF who can shoot the midrange currently in Bagley. This culminates in an appreciation for rebounding, and an ability to guard the rim which the Clippers would lose with the departure of Jordan. Carter has a lot of room to improve on the offensive end but will be solid for the Clippers in a limited offensive role while cleaning up the glass from Blake Griffin isolations.\n\n**12. Philadelphia 76ers (14-17)**\n\n[PG Trevon Duval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6Dy3WHyro)\n\nThis is a luxury pick for the 76ers and they would probably rather take Miles Bridges at this point instead of Duval. However, I would rather see Bridges go to the Jazz at 14 and Duval is a stash guy for when the Bayless contract runs out or Fultz doesn't pan out. Duval is athletic, has quick hands and the court vision that can help distribute the ball around an offense with multiple points of attack. Duval would be very valuable off the bench, which is where he will likely end up. Duval is quick and can beat his man off the dribble, he also had 6 steals in a game earlier this year. Duval is unselfish and relishes his role in the Duke offense as a facilitator, I would love to see him play with the Sixers bench unit. \n\n**13. Phoenix Suns** *via Miami Heat (16-15)*\n\n[SG Hamidou Diallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3vJHdZa7c)\n\nThis pick makes sense even if all I looked at was the school Diallo attends. Diallo would join a backcourt with Booker, Ulis and Brandon Knight, all former Kentucky Wildcats. The Suns desperately need a back up to Booker based upon my quick glance at a Depth Chart, and with the pick of Sexton just earlier, this pick should be spent on their bench. Diallo should be perfect here to play alongside Ulis in the back court and possesses length and athleticism to accompany his scoring ability. Diallo is expected to have huge upside, and will be given time to grow in the Suns organization. Given the previously discussed logjam at Forward positions for the Suns, a Shooting Guard makes the most sense with this pick.  \n\n**14. Utah Jazz (15-18)**\n\n[SF Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blxKm8kVGjQ&amp;t=2s)\n\nThis guy is an absolute monster, and likely will not be available at pick 14 if he leaves after this season. He is a freakish athlete and an absolute menace on the boards. Pairing him with a backcourt of Rubio and Mitchell would be ideal especially with Rudy Gobert and potentially re-signing Derrick Favors locking up the forward position for years. However, If Bridges weren't available for the Jazz at 14, Robert Williams would fill the void nicely at PF for Utah. Regardless, the Jazz are in a good place and Bridges would be an absolute animal backing up Joe Ingles. \n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n**Hawks:** Luke Doncic\n**Grizzlies:** Marvin Bagley III\n**Mavericks:** Deandre Ayton\n**Bulls:** Michael Porter Jr.\n**Magic:** Mo Bamba\n**Hornets:** Trae Young\n**Kings:** Jaren Jackson Jr.\n**Cavaliers:** Kevin Knox\n**76ers:** Mikal Bridges, Trevon Duval\n**Suns:** Collin Sexton, Hamidou Diallo\n**Clippers:** Wendell Carter Jr. \n**Jazz:** Miles Bridges\n\nedit: stuck to -&gt; sticking with harrison barnes under the Mavs pick."}, {"id": "drnlcxg", "body": "Mo Bamba 7'0, Isaac 7'0 and AG 6'9 will be an long and athletic frontcourt the defense will be amazing.

Atlanta Hawks (7-24)** \n\n[SG/PG Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ6GU4unGEg&amp;t=15s) \n\nThe best fit for the Hawks, given that they already have John Collins in their long term plans should be someone at the guard position. Doncic will compliment Schroeder well as another facilitator and can develop into an end of shot clock option down the road. His defensive contribution won't be his best feature in the NBA but he has played professionally in Spain for a few years and shouldn't be overlooked as a defender. At 6'8\" he is tall and an upgrade to Belinelli and Blazemore. Him and John Collins on the boards are a good recipe for success in the next 3 years. He is the best fit for the Hawks because he completes their backcourt and allows a bigger front court role for John Collins. \n\n**2. Memphis Grizzlies (9-23)** *1-2 record against Dallas so far*\n\n[PF Marvin Bagley III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIGP-3y3Qx4)\n\nClearly the best player in the draft class, he would fit great next to Gasol assuming he isn't traded. His offensive tools are next level and it's even more mind blowing considering he wasn't in this draft class until a year ago. He would slot in at the power forward and grab rebounds while the Grizz enjoy his above average mid range shooting and left block post moves. Bagley will improve offensive output of the Grizzlies and will probably have to adjust to the bigger bodies of the NBA but he should still rebound well. \n\n**3. Dallas Mavericks (9-23)** \n\n[C Deandre Ayton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j_fxbScQoc&amp;t=80s)\n\nThe Mavericks are sticking with Harrison Barnes at the 3/4 long term, and not committing to Nerlens Noel after he turned down their massive contract last year. Instead, they should look for a big man. The Arizona center looks to be developing an outside shot and over 7 feet tall. He would fit in well with this team and can develop a great pick and roll game with DSJ that would lead to lots of midrange shots or better lanes for DSJ. If he can develop into a rim protector as well then the Mavericks will have struck gold at the 3rd pick. \n\n**4. Chicago Bulls (10-21)**\n\n[SF Michael Porter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFcDqubVQxs)\n\nThis is a slightly risky pick currently with his back issues. However, with the emergence of the real KD and the Finnisher in the windy city, a small forward is their pick to solidify lineup of the future. With his ability *in high school* to get to the rim and finish above smaller defenders at 6'10\", he should be able to slash well in this offense. He has shown a proficient ability to shoot the three but has yet to appear in significant time at Missouri due to a back injury. Despite his questionable health currently, I think he is worth the gamble and will flourish with an increased role in Chicago. \n\n**5. Orlando Magic (11-21)**\n\n[C Mo Bamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y77tHIX-kEs)\n\nBamba is still pretty raw, but will have time to develop behind Vucci Mane in Orlando. With drafting Jonathon Isaac and long term contracts looming for both Payton and Aaron Gordon, a center makes sense here. Bamba has a massive 7'9\" wingspan and can develop into an elite rim protector. His offensive game leaves much to desire but he shouldn't be burdened with scoring in Orlando and his defense can be invaluable off the bench, at a much better price than Biyombo. Overall, this team is young and has room to grow, and Bamba should fit in well with little pressure to perform immediately in Orlando. \n\n**6. Charlotte Hornets (11-20)**\n\n[PG Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-pzOchpUM)\n\nTrae Young is a scoring guard with next level court vision to match. With the Hornets struggling to find both bench scoring and a suitable backup to Kemba Walker, this pick is a no brainer if he's still available. Kemba can teach the undersized guard the ways of finishing in the NBA, not like Young needs much guidance as he already exhibits the best floater in college basketball. He is deadly from three point and has shown big league range already. He scored 43 on Oregon and finished a game with 22 assists while also scoring 26 points already this season. \n\n**7. Sacramento Kings (11-20)**\n\n[PF/C Jaren Jackson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipnrqPO22A)\n\nThis was a tough decision, as the Kings already have WCS, Skal and Harry Giles at the forward spots. However, with Giles injury concerns and a lack of real frontrunner at the 4 and 5 for the kings, this pick feels good for them. Jackson has an unorthodox shot that may take some fixing, but he is a skilled rebounder, is athletic for his height and can rebound with the best of them. He can be a rim protector down the line and can potentially offer some scoring once Zach Randolph decides to hang em up. \n\n**8. Cleveland Cavaliers** *via Brooklyn Nets (11-19)*\n\n[SF Kevin Knox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RM4aj7CETk)\n\nThe Cavs should take best available with the Brooklyn pick and in my mind that would be Kevin Knox. He has serious length at 6'9\", incredible athletic ability that helps him finish around the rim and a good jumper. Assuming the Cavs hold on to Lebron, he will be an excellent addition off the bench for this team as he can create his own shot. Knox is also a good rebounder at the 3 and has length to play a small ball 4 off the bench. If Lebron does leave, Knox will either fill in and get increased minutes, or come off the bench and back up the replacement brought in. Either way, this is a win for both player and team as Knox should develop into a solid wing. \n\n**9. Philadelphia 76ers** *via Los Angeles Lakers (11-18)*\n\n[SG Mikal Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmukx6YJoHs)\n\nThis is one of my favorite players to watch in college basketball.

Philadelphia 76ers (14-17)**\n\n[PG Trevon Duval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6Dy3WHyro)\n\nThis is a luxury pick for the 76ers and they would probably rather take Miles Bridges at this point instead of Duval. However, I would rather see Bridges go to the Jazz at 14 and Duval is a stash guy for when the Bayless contract runs out or Fultz doesn't pan out. Duval is athletic, has quick hands and the court vision that can help distribute the ball around an offense with multiple points of attack. Duval would be very valuable off the bench, which is where he will likely end up. Duval is quick and can beat his man off the dribble, he also had 6 steals in a game earlier this year. Duval is unselfish and relishes his role in the Duke offense as a facilitator, I would love to see him play with the Sixers bench unit. \n\n**13. Phoenix Suns** *via Miami Heat (16-15)*\n\n[SG Hamidou Diallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3vJHdZa7c)\n\nThis pick makes sense even if all I looked at was the school Diallo attends. Diallo would join a backcourt with Booker, Ulis and Brandon Knight, all former Kentucky Wildcats. The Suns desperately need a back up to Booker based upon my quick glance at a Depth Chart, and with the pick of Sexton just earlier, this pick should be spent on their bench. Diallo should be perfect here to play alongside Ulis in the back court and possesses length and athleticism to accompany his scoring ability. Diallo is expected to have huge upside, and will be given time to grow in the Suns organization. Given the previously discussed logjam at Forward positions for the Suns, a Shooting Guard makes the most sense with this pick.  \n\n**14. Utah Jazz (15-18)**\n\n[SF Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blxKm8kVGjQ&amp;t=2s)\n\nThis guy is an absolute monster, and likely will not be available at pick 14 if he leaves after this season. He is a freakish athlete and an absolute menace on the boards. Pairing him with a backcourt of Rubio and Mitchell would be ideal especially with Rudy Gobert and potentially re-signing Derrick Favors locking up the forward position for years. However, If Bridges weren't available for the Jazz at 14, Robert Williams would fill the void nicely at PF for Utah. Regardless, the Jazz are in a good place and Bridges would be an absolute animal backing up Joe Ingles. \n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n**Hawks:** Luke Doncic\n**Grizzlies:** Marvin Bagley III\n**Mavericks:** Deandre Ayton\n**Bulls:** Michael Porter Jr.\n**Magic:** Mo Bamba\n**Hornets:** Trae Young\n**Kings:** Jaren Jackson Jr.\n**Cavaliers:** Kevin Knox\n**76ers:** Mikal Bridges, Trevon Duval\n**Suns:** Collin Sexton, Hamidou Diallo\n**Clippers:** Wendell Carter Jr. \n**Jazz:** Miles Bridges\n\nedit: stuck to -&gt; sticking with harrison barnes under the Mavs pick."}, {"id": "drnlowa", "body": "Don't think we could afford to take another non-shooter like Duval, even if he does come off the bench.

Atlanta Hawks (7-24)** \n\n[SG/PG Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ6GU4unGEg&amp;t=15s) \n\nThe best fit for the Hawks, given that they already have John Collins in their long term plans should be someone at the guard position. Doncic will compliment Schroeder well as another facilitator and can develop into an end of shot clock option down the road. His defensive contribution won't be his best feature in the NBA but he has played professionally in Spain for a few years and shouldn't be overlooked as a defender. At 6'8\" he is tall and an upgrade to Belinelli and Blazemore. Him and John Collins on the boards are a good recipe for success in the next 3 years. He is the best fit for the Hawks because he completes their backcourt and allows a bigger front court role for John Collins. \n\n**2. Memphis Grizzlies (9-23)** *1-2 record against Dallas so far*\n\n[PF Marvin Bagley III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIGP-3y3Qx4)\n\nClearly the best player in the draft class, he would fit great next to Gasol assuming he isn't traded. His offensive tools are next level and it's even more mind blowing considering he wasn't in this draft class until a year ago. He would slot in at the power forward and grab rebounds while the Grizz enjoy his above average mid range shooting and left block post moves. Bagley will improve offensive output of the Grizzlies and will probably have to adjust to the bigger bodies of the NBA but he should still rebound well. \n\n**3. Dallas Mavericks (9-23)** \n\n[C Deandre Ayton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j_fxbScQoc&amp;t=80s)\n\nThe Mavericks are sticking with Harrison Barnes at the 3/4 long term, and not committing to Nerlens Noel after he turned down their massive contract last year. Instead, they should look for a big man. The Arizona center looks to be developing an outside shot and over 7 feet tall. He would fit in well with this team and can develop a great pick and roll game with DSJ that would lead to lots of midrange shots or better lanes for DSJ. If he can develop into a rim protector as well then the Mavericks will have struck gold at the 3rd pick. \n\n**4. Chicago Bulls (10-21)**\n\n[SF Michael Porter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFcDqubVQxs)\n\nThis is a slightly risky pick currently with his back issues. However, with the emergence of the real KD and the Finnisher in the windy city, a small forward is their pick to solidify lineup of the future. With his ability *in high school* to get to the rim and finish above smaller defenders at 6'10\", he should be able to slash well in this offense. He has shown a proficient ability to shoot the three but has yet to appear in significant time at Missouri due to a back injury. Despite his questionable health currently, I think he is worth the gamble and will flourish with an increased role in Chicago. \n\n**5. Orlando Magic (11-21)**\n\n[C Mo Bamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y77tHIX-kEs)\n\nBamba is still pretty raw, but will have time to develop behind Vucci Mane in Orlando. With drafting Jonathon Isaac and long term contracts looming for both Payton and Aaron Gordon, a center makes sense here. Bamba has a massive 7'9\" wingspan and can develop into an elite rim protector. His offensive game leaves much to desire but he shouldn't be burdened with scoring in Orlando and his defense can be invaluable off the bench, at a much better price than Biyombo. Overall, this team is young and has room to grow, and Bamba should fit in well with little pressure to perform immediately in Orlando. \n\n**6. Charlotte Hornets (11-20)**\n\n[PG Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-pzOchpUM)\n\nTrae Young is a scoring guard with next level court vision to match. With the Hornets struggling to find both bench scoring and a suitable backup to Kemba Walker, this pick is a no brainer if he's still available. Kemba can teach the undersized guard the ways of finishing in the NBA, not like Young needs much guidance as he already exhibits the best floater in college basketball. He is deadly from three point and has shown big league range already. He scored 43 on Oregon and finished a game with 22 assists while also scoring 26 points already this season. \n\n**7. Sacramento Kings (11-20)**\n\n[PF/C Jaren Jackson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipnrqPO22A)\n\nThis was a tough decision, as the Kings already have WCS, Skal and Harry Giles at the forward spots. However, with Giles injury concerns and a lack of real frontrunner at the 4 and 5 for the kings, this pick feels good for them. Jackson has an unorthodox shot that may take some fixing, but he is a skilled rebounder, is athletic for his height and can rebound with the best of them. He can be a rim protector down the line and can potentially offer some scoring once Zach Randolph decides to hang em up. \n\n**8. Cleveland Cavaliers** *via Brooklyn Nets (11-19)*\n\n[SF Kevin Knox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RM4aj7CETk)\n\nThe Cavs should take best available with the Brooklyn pick and in my mind that would be Kevin Knox. He has serious length at 6'9\", incredible athletic ability that helps him finish around the rim and a good jumper. Assuming the Cavs hold on to Lebron, he will be an excellent addition off the bench for this team as he can create his own shot. Knox is also a good rebounder at the 3 and has length to play a small ball 4 off the bench. If Lebron does leave, Knox will either fill in and get increased minutes, or come off the bench and back up the replacement brought in. Either way, this is a win for both player and team as Knox should develop into a solid wing. \n\n**9. Philadelphia 76ers** *via Los Angeles Lakers (11-18)*\n\n[SG Mikal Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmukx6YJoHs)\n\nThis is one of my favorite players to watch in college basketball. He is a legit scoring threat who rebounds well in the college game. This guy is a shooter who can also score around the rim and will fit in perfectly for the Sixers. He is also a solid defender who is constantly working on the defensive end. All around, this pick is mostly due to the Sixers having their long term solutions at the forward slots in Covington, Simmons and Embiid. Additionally, a point guard doesn't make sense here as we still have yet to see a healthy Fultz take the offense and Saric being a solid compliment to Embiid. \n\n**10. Phoenix Suns (12-22)**\n\n[PG Colin Sexton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBUKjrMp_s)\n\nSexton is an absolute beast, he's got elite speed and good length to develop into a solid NBA guard. Sexton has already shown his ability to score, and score in bunches. Additionally, his speed should help him run exceptionally well in transition and have an easier time defending smaller guards in the NBA than Trae Young. In fact, with Devin Booker being a purely offensive talent at this point, I think this is a better fit than Trae Young for the Suns long-term. Additionally, with Josh Jackson showing similar athleticism and speed, Sexton would easily make the Suns my favorite team to watch. As bigs such as Dragan Bender and Alex Len are still looking to validate their status as lottery picks, I think a PG to replace Bledsoe is best at this spot given how many quality bigs were taken earlier. Additionally, the Suns hold the Heat pick three picks later, and shouldn't bank on Sexton being available then. \n\n**11. Los Angeles Clippers (12-18)**\n\n[Wendell Carter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBi61zvzhg)\n\nWith the prospect of losing DeAndre Jordan, this pick makes sense for the Clippers. The clippers have depth at Point Guard with Teodosic and Beverley as well as serviceable depth at the 2 with Rivers and potentially re-signing Lou Williams. However, Carter at 6'10\" would slot into Center better than Robert Williams would in this team. Additionally, Carter plays alongside a PF who can shoot the midrange currently in Bagley. This culminates in an appreciation for rebounding, and an ability to guard the rim which the Clippers would lose with the departure of Jordan. Carter has a lot of room to improve on the offensive end but will be solid for the Clippers in a limited offensive role while cleaning up the glass from Blake Griffin isolations.\n\n**12.

He would fit in well with this team and can develop a great pick and roll game with DSJ that would lead to lots of midrange shots or better lanes for DSJ. If he can develop into a rim protector as well then the Mavericks will have struck gold at the 3rd pick. \n\n**4. Chicago Bulls (10-21)**\n\n[SF Michael Porter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFcDqubVQxs)\n\nThis is a slightly risky pick currently with his back issues. However, with the emergence of the real KD and the Finnisher in the windy city, a small forward is their pick to solidify lineup of the future. With his ability *in high school* to get to the rim and finish above smaller defenders at 6'10\", he should be able to slash well in this offense. He has shown a proficient ability to shoot the three but has yet to appear in significant time at Missouri due to a back injury. Despite his questionable health currently, I think he is worth the gamble and will flourish with an increased role in Chicago. \n\n**5. Orlando Magic (11-21)**\n\n[C Mo Bamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y77tHIX-kEs)\n\nBamba is still pretty raw, but will have time to develop behind Vucci Mane in Orlando. With drafting Jonathon Isaac and long term contracts looming for both Payton and Aaron Gordon, a center makes sense here. Bamba has a massive 7'9\" wingspan and can develop into an elite rim protector. His offensive game leaves much to desire but he shouldn't be burdened with scoring in Orlando and his defense can be invaluable off the bench, at a much better price than Biyombo. Overall, this team is young and has room to grow, and Bamba should fit in well with little pressure to perform immediately in Orlando. \n\n**6. Charlotte Hornets (11-20)**\n\n[PG Trae Young](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK-pzOchpUM)\n\nTrae Young is a scoring guard with next level court vision to match. With the Hornets struggling to find both bench scoring and a suitable backup to Kemba Walker, this pick is a no brainer if he's still available. Kemba can teach the undersized guard the ways of finishing in the NBA, not like Young needs much guidance as he already exhibits the best floater in college basketball. He is deadly from three point and has shown big league range already. He scored 43 on Oregon and finished a game with 22 assists while also scoring 26 points already this season. \n\n**7. Sacramento Kings (11-20)**\n\n[PF/C Jaren Jackson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipnrqPO22A)\n\nThis was a tough decision, as the Kings already have WCS, Skal and Harry Giles at the forward spots. However, with Giles injury concerns and a lack of real frontrunner at the 4 and 5 for the kings, this pick feels good for them. Jackson has an unorthodox shot that may take some fixing, but he is a skilled rebounder, is athletic for his height and can rebound with the best of them. He can be a rim protector down the line and can potentially offer some scoring once Zach Randolph decides to hang em up. \n\n**8. Cleveland Cavaliers** *via Brooklyn Nets (11-19)*\n\n[SF Kevin Knox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RM4aj7CETk)\n\nThe Cavs should take best available with the Brooklyn pick and in my mind that would be Kevin Knox. He has serious length at 6'9\", incredible athletic ability that helps him finish around the rim and a good jumper. Assuming the Cavs hold on to Lebron, he will be an excellent addition off the bench for this team as he can create his own shot. Knox is also a good rebounder at the 3 and has length to play a small ball 4 off the bench. If Lebron does leave, Knox will either fill in and get increased minutes, or come off the bench and back up the replacement brought in. Either way, this is a win for both player and team as Knox should develop into a solid wing. \n\n**9. Philadelphia 76ers** *via Los Angeles Lakers (11-18)*\n\n[SG Mikal Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pmukx6YJoHs)\n\nThis is one of my favorite players to watch in college basketball. He is a legit scoring threat who rebounds well in the college game. This guy is a shooter who can also score around the rim and will fit in perfectly for the Sixers. He is also a solid defender who is constantly working on the defensive end. All around, this pick is mostly due to the Sixers having their long term solutions at the forward slots in Covington, Simmons and Embiid. Additionally, a point guard doesn't make sense here as we still have yet to see a healthy Fultz take the offense and Saric being a solid compliment to Embiid. \n\n**10. Phoenix Suns (12-22)**\n\n[PG Colin Sexton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkBUKjrMp_s)\n\nSexton is an absolute beast, he's got elite speed and good length to develop into a solid NBA guard. Sexton has already shown his ability to score, and score in bunches. Additionally, his speed should help him run exceptionally well in transition and have an easier time defending smaller guards in the NBA than Trae Young. In fact, with Devin Booker being a purely offensive talent at this point, I think this is a better fit than Trae Young for the Suns long-term. Additionally, with Josh Jackson showing similar athleticism and speed, Sexton would easily make the Suns my favorite team to watch. As bigs such as Dragan Bender and Alex Len are still looking to validate their status as lottery picks, I think a PG to replace Bledsoe is best at this spot given how many quality bigs were taken earlier. Additionally, the Suns hold the Heat pick three picks later, and shouldn't bank on Sexton being available then. \n\n**11. Los Angeles Clippers (12-18)**\n\n[Wendell Carter Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYBi61zvzhg)\n\nWith the prospect of losing DeAndre Jordan, this pick makes sense for the Clippers. The clippers have depth at Point Guard with Teodosic and Beverley as well as serviceable depth at the 2 with Rivers and potentially re-signing Lou Williams. However, Carter at 6'10\" would slot into Center better than Robert Williams would in this team. Additionally, Carter plays alongside a PF who can shoot the midrange currently in Bagley. This culminates in an appreciation for rebounding, and an ability to guard the rim which the Clippers would lose with the departure of Jordan. Carter has a lot of room to improve on the offensive end but will be solid for the Clippers in a limited offensive role while cleaning up the glass from Blake Griffin isolations.\n\n**12. Philadelphia 76ers (14-17)**\n\n[PG Trevon Duval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6Dy3WHyro)\n\nThis is a luxury pick for the 76ers and they would probably rather take Miles Bridges at this point instead of Duval. However, I would rather see Bridges go to the Jazz at 14 and Duval is a stash guy for when the Bayless contract runs out or Fultz doesn't pan out. Duval is athletic, has quick hands and the court vision that can help distribute the ball around an offense with multiple points of attack. Duval would be very valuable off the bench, which is where he will likely end up. Duval is quick and can beat his man off the dribble, he also had 6 steals in a game earlier this year. Duval is unselfish and relishes his role in the Duke offense as a facilitator, I would love to see him play with the Sixers bench unit. \n\n**13. Phoenix Suns** *via Miami Heat (16-15)*\n\n[SG Hamidou Diallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3vJHdZa7c)\n\nThis pick makes sense even if all I looked at was the school Diallo attends. Diallo would join a backcourt with Booker, Ulis and Brandon Knight, all former Kentucky Wildcats. The Suns desperately need a back up to Booker based upon my quick glance at a Depth Chart, and with the pick of Sexton just earlier, this pick should be spent on their bench. Diallo should be perfect here to play alongside Ulis in the back court and possesses length and athleticism to accompany his scoring ability. Diallo is expected to have huge upside, and will be given time to grow in the Suns organization. Given the previously discussed logjam at Forward positions for the Suns, a Shooting Guard makes the most sense with this pick.  \n\n**14. Utah Jazz (15-18)**\n\n[SF Miles Bridges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blxKm8kVGjQ&amp;t=2s)\n\nThis guy is an absolute monster, and likely will not be available at pick 14 if he leaves after this season. He is a freakish athlete and an absolute menace on the boards. Pairing him with a backcourt of Rubio and Mitchell would be ideal especially with Rudy Gobert and potentially re-signing Derrick Favors locking up the forward position for years. However, If Bridges weren't available for the Jazz at 14, Robert Williams would fill the void nicely at PF for Utah. Regardless, the Jazz are in a good place and Bridges would be an absolute animal backing up Joe Ingles. \n\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n**Hawks:** Luke Doncic\n**Grizzlies:** Marvin Bagley III\n**Mavericks:** Deandre Ayton\n**Bulls:** Michael Porter Jr.\n**Magic:** Mo Bamba\n**Hornets:** Trae Young\n**Kings:** Jaren Jackson Jr.\n**Cavaliers:** Kevin Knox\n**76ers:** Mikal Bridges, Trevon Duval\n**Suns:** Collin Sexton, Hamidou Diallo\n**Clippers:** Wendell Carter Jr. \n**Jazz:** Miles Bridges\n\nedit: stuck to -&gt; sticking with harrison barnes under the Mavs pick."}, {"id": "drnnacu", "body": "I'm getting lower and lower on Bamba.

I get that he's quick, but I question his role in the NBA if that's all he's got. Compared to Fox, for instance, his jumper is a good bit scarier, he doesn't get to the line as much, and he's a lower volume scorer as well. Sure he could be great if you just pencil in a solid jumper, but that's a huge ask given where he's at. I'd rather take a chance on some two way wings there rather than pray for him to develop a jumper out of nowhere.

Atlanta Hawks (7-24)** \n\n[SG/PG Luka Doncic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ6GU4unGEg&amp;t=15s) \n\nThe best fit for the Hawks, given that they already have John Collins in their long term plans should be someone at the guard position. Doncic will compliment Schroeder well as another facilitator and can develop into an end of shot clock option down the road. His defensive contribution won't be his best feature in the NBA but he has played professionally in Spain for a few years and shouldn't be overlooked as a defender. At 6'8\" he is tall and an upgrade to Belinelli and Blazemore. Him and John Collins on the boards are a good recipe for success in the next 3 years. He is the best fit for the Hawks because he completes their backcourt and allows a bigger front court role for John Collins. \n\n**2. Memphis Grizzlies (9-23)** *1-2 record against Dallas so far*\n\n[PF Marvin Bagley III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIGP-3y3Qx4)\n\nClearly the best player in the draft class, he would fit great next to Gasol assuming he isn't traded. His offensive tools are next level and it's even more mind blowing considering he wasn't in this draft class until a year ago. He would slot in at the power forward and grab rebounds while the Grizz enjoy his above average mid range shooting and left block post moves. Bagley will improve offensive output of the Grizzlies and will probably have to adjust to the bigger bodies of the NBA but he should still rebound well. \n\n**3.
