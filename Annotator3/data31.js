But he's not what I think basketball is about to me and a lot of others. He will pad stats, be lazy on defense, get tunnel vision and generally make bad decisions when it comes down the stretch. And a lot of it isn't his fault, sometimes he just has nobody to rely on, so he takes it on himself. He plays hero ball a lot and when it works, its amazing and unique and awe inspiring but sucks to be on the bad end of. Especially as a teammate and a fan of defense, passing and \"smart\" basketball. \n\nThe US gets criticized for glamorizing showmanship in basketball, which rubs on negatively on kids. Preferring highlight plays and dunks over smart passing and selflessness. Sure at a high level basketball may be fun to watch someone of Russel's athletic caliber take over a game but for other countries and lower level league's (from pee wee to high school to europe) it's more frustrating because they covet team play, bball movement and high bbiq. While I wish my kids would have his athleticism and be able to move like he does, I'm not showing them tapes of Russel's stuff to teach them how to play and model their game after.
