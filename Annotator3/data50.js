A post game unrivalled by any player not named McHale or Hakeem, along with his ability to turn into a black hole on defense. This Kareem carried a dumpster fire of a Lakers team to the WCF in the most talent-stacked NBA season, especially after the ABA merger.)\n\n---\n\nBench: \n\nG: '89 Isiah Thomas (Greatest PURE point guard ever)\n\nG: '16 Curry (I mean, come on, let's make it rain)\n\nG: '08 Wade (I need a dominant slasher for when MJ and Lebron come off)\n\nF: '92 Pippen\n\nF: '86 Bird (ultimate teammate, unselfish passer, 3PT pioneer and leader of the second unit)\n\nF: '87 McHale (The post maestro) \n\nC: '77 Bill Walton (Won Finals with the weakest championship team in history in arguably the most loaded NBA season ever)\n\n---\n\nCoach: Gregg Popovich\n\n---\n\nNotable Omissions: \n\n'93 Malone (bad in clutch, no jump shot, not as good defensively as TD), '91 Rodman (no shot outside 5 feet of the rim), '94 Hakeem (already got post scoring in Kareem and TD, and I don't see Hakeem being too happy coming off the bench), '93 Stockton, '17 Kawhi (I got Pippen, I don't need The Claw), '09 Kobe (lots and lots of chemistry issues), '04 Kobe (still unsure about chemistry), '01 Shaq (Hack-A-Shaqs for days, plus spacing issues), '65 Bill Russell (6'9 center who can't shoot.

If you're curious about his averages last season at his age/year in the league, the list of guys above him becomes Jordan, Lebron, Kyrie, Blake Griffin and below him Isiah Thomas, Allen iverson. Obviously this list isn't fair because the seasons not over, but he's taken another step up and is playing like a superstar. His defense is much improved despite being on the worst defensive team in the league and like what we've seen with Kyrie that can really affect someones statistics and the perception of how good of a defender they are. I hope he keeps playing this well for the sake of my franchise and I hope they can build the team around him that he deserves. \n\nLink to the basketball reference\n\nhttps://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_game&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=3&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=18&amp;age_max=21&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=24&amp;c2stat=trb_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=4&amp;c3stat=ast_per_g&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=4&amp;c4stat=mp_per_g&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=20&amp;order_by=ts_pct\n\n"}, {"id": "drua4nn", "body": "When they mention Pac Biggie and Jay Z don't forget Weezy baby\n\n- Lil Wayne\n\nWhen they mention Jordan and LeBron don't forget about Booker baby\n\n- OP"}, {"id": "drua4nn", "body": "When they mention Pac Biggie and Jay Z don't forget Weezy baby\n\n- Lil Wayne\n\nWhen they mention Jordan and LeBron don't forget about Booker baby\n\n- OP"}, {"id": "druaaxu", "body": "Pac, Biggie, and Jay is to rap as Jordan, lebron, and Booker is to basketball.\n\nI like that better.

Obviously this list isn't fair because the seasons not over, but he's taken another step up and is playing like a superstar. His defense is much improved despite being on the worst defensive team in the league and like what we've seen with Kyrie that can really affect someones statistics and the perception of how good of a defender they are. I hope he keeps playing this well for the sake of my franchise and I hope they can build the team around him that he deserves. \n\nLink to the basketball reference\n\nhttps://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;type=per_game&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=3&amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;age_min=18&amp;age_max=21&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;as_comp=gt&amp;as_val=0&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;c1stat=pts_per_g&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=24&amp;c2stat=trb_per_g&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=4&amp;c3stat=ast_per_g&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=4&amp;c4stat=mp_per_g&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=20&amp;order_by=ts_pct\n\n"}, {"id": "drujnn4", "body": "Booker would always be in these \u2018age-based\u2019 qualifier stats because he\u2019s young relative to his draft class, and getting major minutes and usage on a rebuilding team.

Jordan got to the line more than both of them and obviously Lebron has 10+ seasons with more than that but it just is what is. Idk why you would assume his shooting is unsustainable. It could be, or it could not be. His shooting and scoring improvements are expected on a good, young, scoring player. If you looked at stephs numbers early in the year 2015-2016 you would\u2019ve said they were unsustainable, but when he sustained them your argument would be gone.

When sorted by TS% the order still goes Jordan, Booker, Lebron, everyone else. If you're curious about his averages last season at his age/year in the league, the list of guys above him becomes Jordan, Lebron, Kyrie, Blake Griffin and below him Isiah Thomas, Allen iverson. Obviously this list isn't fair because the seasons not over, but he's taken another step up and is playing like a superstar. His defense is much improved despite being on the worst defensive team in the league and like what we've seen with Kyrie that can really affect someones statistics and the perception of how good of a defender they are.
