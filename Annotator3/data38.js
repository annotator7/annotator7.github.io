Guatemala Maya, for example, consume only approximately 80% of the total energy needed for healthy growth, and 20.4% are also iodine deficient [53]. Iodine deficiency during infancy and childhood results in reduced leg length, especially the distal femur, the tibia and the foot [54]. Maya children and adults spend considerable time and energy at heavy labor [55], which diverts available energy in the diet away from growth. This nutrition and lifestyle combination is known to reduce total stature and leg length [56]. \n\nIt's not diet though, you right.
