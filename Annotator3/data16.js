The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.\n\n1998:\n#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby\n#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi\nThis does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbb7lm", "body": "Id love it if we got Yao, but would have hated if we got Beasley.

Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbb7op", "body": "Poor Clips.

Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans?

Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbbbs7", "body": "This question to me is more interesting in the years were there was a level of legitimate debate between the no 1 vs no 2 guy(ie 2004 many people had Okafor&gt;Dwight).

I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbez53", "body": "Pistons with lebron would be unfair.\n\nLbj would have far more rings too"}, {"id": "drbez53", "body": "Pistons with lebron would be unfair.\n\nLbj would have far more rings too"}, {"id": "drbieay", "body": "I got a bit erect when I saw 2003 ngl"}, {"id": "drbieay", "body": "I got a bit erect when I saw 2003 ngl"}, {"id": "drbvalw", "body": "I didn't, but then I realized that Malice at the Palace may not have happened in this timeline."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7k3oc7", "body": "I'm a big fan of what-ifs. The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.\n\n1998:\n#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby\n#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi\nThis does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups?

Nobody knows if LeBron is a point or a shooting guard.\u201d - Alberto Dal Cin, scout for the Utah Jazz\n\nhttp://thecomeback.com/freezingcoldtakes/nba/tons-of-people-wanted-the-cavs-to-draft-melo-even-darko-over-lebron-james.html\n\n&gt;\u201cAt the risk of blasphemy, I don\u2019t take LeBron James. If I have the No. 1 pick and can somehow trade it while still getting Carmelo Anthony, that\u2019s what I do. I trade the rights to James to a team desperate enough to give me value for all the overinflated hype James brings with him, and the seats it will fill, and drop to No. 2 or 3. And then I make my team better more immediately with Anthony than I do with James\u2026\u201d - Dan Le Batard\n\n&gt;\"NBA Draft memo to the Miami Heat: Carmelo Anthony. If the pingpong balls bounce in Miami\u2019s favor and it gets the first pick in the selection process, the Heat should take Anthony. That\u2019s how good he is. That\u2019s how good he\u2019s going to be. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d - Greg Stoda, Palm Beach Post\n\n&gt;\u201cThat brings us back to Anthony, who is the subject of silent prayers of many NBA teams hoping they get the third pick and not one of the first two. They want Anthony, but they know they can\u2019t take him if they get one of the first two picks. The system won\u2019t allow it.\u201d - Davd Dupree, USA Today\n\nLast but not least, Mike D'Antoni:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OldTakesExposed/status/877859624572944385/photo/1"}, {"id": "drciz16", "body": "Only two of those are people in actual NBA orgs, and D'Antoni is the only one who would actually be able to probably singlehandedly alter his orgs decision.

The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.\n\n1998:\n#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby\n#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi\nThis does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbg03g", "body": "KAT, Ben and Fultz.

Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbi65a", "body": "I feel like I should just not even be surprised that a post about NBA draft history got me all TRIGGERED.

The NBA draft is arguably one of the easiest sources of what-ifs, and I found myself today thinking how different the league might look if Portland had taken Kevin Durant instead of Seattle (sorry Blazer bros). Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.\n\n1998:\n#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby\n#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi\nThis does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers.

Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbitij", "body": "We would have KAT.

Got me to wondering how the league would look if some other drafts were flipped.\n\n1998:\n#1 - Clippers - Mike Bibby\n#2 - Grizzlies - Michael Olowakandi\nThis does not change much historically. Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really. Cavs fans would be on suicide watch. They had already had a very rough last ten years leading up to this draft. Darko would be the nail in the coffin. And Pistons fans? Imagine Chauncey, Rip, LeBron, Rasheed, and Ben Wallace with Tayshaun off the bench. Is that 70 wins year in and year out? Fuckin A. Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow).

Obviously this never would have happened but it's fun to imagine I suppose\n\n2004: \n#1 - Magic - Emeka Okafor\n#2 - Bobcats - Dwight Howard\nWhile the Magic never won a title, it's hard to imagine them being relevant with Okafor at all, even though he was an incredibly serviceable big man for a long while. Charlotte gets the perfect building block to start their rebuild; maybe they are still the Bobcats if Dwight leads them to success, and maybe no one hates Dwight Howard. Eh or maybe everyone still does\n\n2005: \n#1 - Bucks - Marvin Williams\n#2 - Hawks - Andrew Bogut\nOne of the blander Top 2's. I suppose you could make the case that Bogut going to Atlanta means no Bogut going to the Dubs, which maybe means no Warriors dynasty. Maybe. Bucks would have been pissed with Marvin Williams. Hawks may have been fun though; Bogut's play style was similar to Horfords back in the day in regards to passing out of the high post (obviously not the shooter Horford was/is). Hawks don't change too much I don't think\n\n2006:\n#1 - Raptors - LaMarcus Aldridge\n#2 - Bulls - Andrea Bargnani\nOf course, the Bulls ended up trading Aldridge to Portland for Tyrus Thomas (ow). Bulls fans, would you rather have had Tyrus Thomas or Andrea Bargnani? I'll take a pair of adidas socks and some beats by dre over either guy, thank you. Raptors are scary as shit though. Aldridge + Bosh? that's V E R S A T I L I T Y. Maybe Bosh never goes to Miami, and there is no big three (also, LeBron is in Detroit killing it so he ain't leaving). \n\n2007: \n#1 - Blazers - Kevin Durant\n#2 - Sonics - Greg Oden\nSo, in this scenario, Portland does not have Aldridge; instead they have Tyrus fucking Thomas. BUT they still have Brandon Roy. So we get at least a few good years of Roy - Durant, which is absolute dynamite. Maybe a lesser scoring load means Roy's knees hold up longer. Who knows. For the Sonics, it's a punch in the nuts. I've been saying injuries may not have happened in different scenarios for some of these guys, but I believe Oden would have been hurt no matter where he ended up. But maybe by not having Durant, the Sonics/Thunder would have kept Harden, meaning we still see a Harden/Westbrook backcourt. Could there have been some Durant/Roy vs. Harden/Westbrook matchups? I'm sad there wasn't.\n\n2008:\n#1 - Bulls - Michael Beasley\n#2 - Heat - Derrick Rose\nAt this point, the big three in Miami probably isn't happening, as LBJ is in Detroit winning titles and Bosh is leading Toronto deep in the playoffs with Lamarcus by his side. So Wade needs a side-kick. How about another dynamic, slashing guard? No one would be able to contain a Rose/Wade backcourt; it would have been disgusting. The Bulls would have been fucked. Now they have Beasley, Deng, Hinrich, and Yao. Solid squad... but not a contender like they were with Rose.\n\n2009:\n#1 - Clippers - Hasheem Thabeet\n#2 - Grizzles - Blake Griffin\nIf this exercise has taught me anything, it's that things could have been much worse for the Clippers. In our scenario, we have the Clips ending up with Thabeet and Kwame Brown as top 2 draft picks. Fuck. Clips bball would still be dead today. Grizz would be nice, pairing Griffin with Marc Gasol and Mike Conley. that's a championship contending trio right there.\n\n2010:\n#1 - Wizards - Evan Turner\n#2 - 76ers - John Wall\nProcess? fuck the process! Sixers wouldn't need to tank, as a team with John Wall, Jrue Holiday, and Andre Iguodala would be supremely athletic. That might not be a title nucleus, but they'd be a perennial playoff team for years. The Wizards... not so much. I mean, maybe Turner gets a chance to shine as the lone scoring option, but his inability to shoot would have hindered him wherever he ended up. Wiz would be screwed.\n\n2011:\n#1 - Cavs - Derrick Williams\n#2 - Timberwolves - Kyrie Irving\nMan Cavs really getting dicked here. No LeBron, and now no Kyrie. But hey, Derrick Williams! Crazy to think that these two guys went back-to-back; ones out of the league and ones a bonafide star. Minnesota has a Kyrie - Love tandem, which is funny. And Cleveland continues to be horrific, all the time. That Mo Williams - Derrick Williams - Darko trio would have been lit\n\n2012: \n#1 - Hornets - Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\n#2 - Bobcats - Anthony Davis\nHey! Bobcats score a stud! In our redraft, the Bobcats have gotten AD and Dwight in an 8 year span. Im retroactively ordering bobcats gear as we speak. The hornets get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, which is who he currently plays for, but the Hornets are the Pelicans and the Bobcats are the Hornets so... yup.\n\n2013:\n#1 - Cavs - Victor Oladipo\n#2 - Magic - Anthony Bennett\nThe Cavs finally get their superstar. Oladipo has proven to be the best player in the NBA this season and, possibly, the best player of all time. Can't believe the Magic eventually traded the GOAT for half a season of Serge Ibaka. For the Magic, this is sad, and also not happy. They get Bennett, who enjoys those Florida eats and balloons to 430lbs. Nothing magical about that.\n\n2014:\n#1 - Cavs - Jabari Parker\n#2 - Bucks - Andrew Wiggins\nJabari has been great when he's healthy. He just hasn't been healthy. Are the Bucks dramatically better with Wiggins running next to Giannis? Maybe. I think he'd be dynamite as the second option there. A Wiggins/Middleton/Giannis wing trio is long as shit. For the Cavs, they now get Jabari to pair with Oladipo, which is a lot of athleticism and a lot of posters. \n\n2015:\n#1 - Timberwolves - D'Angelo Russell\n#2 - Lakers - Karl-Anthony Towns\nRemember, in this scenario the Wolves have Kevin Love and Kyrie already. Russell would be pretty great as a combo guard next to Kyrie, but that backcourt defense would be a turnstyle. The Lakers get a year of KAT+Kobe, and then can begin to rebuild around an absolute stud. Not even Earvin himself could fuck that up\n\n2016:\n#1 - 76ers - Brandon Ingram\n#2 - Lakers - Ben Simmons\nSixers fans, don't freak. You still have Embiid in this set-up. Ingram is not Simmons, but he's been pretty solid this year and could still turn into a stud. His scoring would look real nice on Philly. For the Lakers, Simmons + Towns is the best young core in the NBA. Durable and dominant.\n\n2017:\n76ers - Lonzo Ball\nLakers - Markelle Fultz\nLaVar Ball is so fuckin pissed. But now the Sixers have a big baller to play next to Embiid. Is a Ball/Covington/Ingram/Saric/Embiid team a playoff contender? I think so. For the Lakers, maybe their organization doesn't rush a kid out onto the court who can't shoot without looking like your chubby friend at the rec. \n\nTL;DR - The league looks pretty different"}, {"id": "drbkk15", "body": "The Warriors still have everyone -- maybe except for bogut.

Grizzlies never get Bibby, which means Sacramento never gets Bibby, which maybe means that the Lakers don't have the big, tough rival Kings to deal with (though J-Will was awesome). Grizzlies get the shittiest kandi a kid can think of.\n\n1999:\n#1 - Bulls - Steve Francis\n#2 - Grizzlies - Elton Brand\nAnother draft where the end result didn't truly matter either way. In real life, Francis pouted his way out of Vancouver before ever suiting up, eventually heading to Houston. I think if the Bulls take him, he ends up playing for Chicago for a bit. No backcourt mob with him and Cat Mobley. Memphis, meanwhile, would be trotting out a Kandiman - Elton Brand... AKA the exact line-up the Clippers sucked with a few years later. \n\n2000:\n#1 - Nets - Stromile Swift\n#2 - Grizzlies - Kenyon Martin\nTake note: Grizz have had the #2 pick three years in a row. Christ. It hurt me having to think about Stromile Swift being the first overall pick in any draft ever (though his dunks were on point). K-Mart to the Grizzlies means they now have drafted three big men in a row. Sixers fans know what I'm talking about.\n\n2001:\n#1 - Wizards - Tyson Chandler\n#2 - Clippers - Kwame Brown\nOverall, the Wiz still wiff on this pick, with Pau Gasol coming off the board at #3. But Tyson is and has been infinitely better than Kwame, even if Kwame kind of got shit on unfairly during his career. This would be sooooooo mid-2000's clippers though to end up with Kwame. Instead they used Chandler to trade for Elton Brand in real life.\n\n2002:\n#1 - Houston - Jay Williams\n#2 - Chicago - Yao Ming\nThis is probably the first draft that has some legitimate implications. Yao is a franchise-altering big. And Williams had moments as a potential stud point guard during his rookie year. Honestly, who knows if either player gets hurt in this scenario. Remember, Houston doesn't have Francis in this scenario, so Jay Williams and Mobley would form a nice backcourt. Of course, they'd rather have Yao. and Chicago gets a STUD to eventually pair with Hinrich, Deng, Gordon, etc. Also fat Eddy Curry has to move to the bench in this scenario\n\n2003: \n#1 - Cavaliers - Darko Milicic\n#2 - Pistons - LeBron James\nhahahahahahahaha holy shit hahahahahahahahahahaha\nBut really.

Even though Kenny said he'll need to earn his minutes, from an outside perspective looking in the Nets are dry when it comes to big men and it seems realistic that they'd want to let him play, right? Their current bigman rotation consists of Jarrett Allen (who while good I've heard is still on limited minutes because of old injuries), Timofey Mozgov, and Tyler Zeller. \n\nI know that, memes aside, a lot of people don't seem to have faith in the guy because of his lack of defensive capabilities/effort, and \"empty\" offensive stats.

"}, {"id": "dqyx7pz", "body": "[Serious]  I think he'll be a terrible player for the Nets because I truly think he's always been deeply flawed to the point that he needs multiple major developments as a player to even become roster worthy on a playoff team.  Here is a list of weaknesses he has that are extremely tough to cover up and are also hard to improve:\n\n*WEAKNESSES*\n\n* Shooting: Jahlil Okafor can't shoot. After showing some flashes in this regard his rookie year he added this horrendous hitch to his motion. I'll always remember the three he hit in the rising stars game but I truly believe it's a lost cause He shoots around 30% everywhere outside outside of 3 feet for his career. If the idea of Jahlil Okafor as a player is as a scoring weapon that is dominant enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies, this is a bad start considering like 1/3 of the centers in the league are shooting threes now, and the majority can at least reliably take open mid range spot up attempts.\n\n* Rebounding: Jahlil Okafor is a terrible rebounder. This is a bigger problem than you think. If you're going to go with a big lineup with a guy like Jahlil, you better be able to punish the other team on the boards. Other teams can put smaller lineups out there which kill Jahlil on the other end without worrying about getting out-rebounded. People like to optimistically compare Jahlil to guys like Monroe and Kanter, but both far superior rebounders (in addition to being better in most other areas), and rebounding is one of the stats that statistically is least likely to improve in time.\n\n* Easy Buckets: Jahlil Okafor does not get easy garbage points often enough. Since he's a terrible rebounder, he doesn't usually get putbacks, and he's too unathletic to catch lobs. These are high efficiency opportunities that most centers can provide. If you want Jahlil to score you need to throw him the ball close to the hoop with the understanding that it's not coming back out, and that it's likely only a 40% proposition that he scores. This is another area where Kanter/Monroe are elite and Jahlil is terrible.  \n\n* Passing: Jahlil Okafor is a terrible passer. He gets the ball in the post, palms it for a couple seconds, puts his head down, and at no point considers the other 4 players around him wearing the same uniform. This is a massive flaw since his only role on offense really is as a suito-focal point because if you're not using him as your primary offensive option, it's not worth having him out there on defense.\n\n* Defensive IQ: Jahlil Okafor simply doesn't understand how to play defense. He's never in the right position, and sometimes if he gets burnt he'll start \"trying,\" which usually means he's just going to foul the person he's guarding for a few possessions before going back to his lackadaisical approach. Think Karl Townsesque defensive decision making but Jahlil is slower so he's never even close to recovering from his mental mistakes.\n\n* Pick and Roll Defense: Jahlil Okafor is too slow to guard the pick and roll, even if he does happen to try on the given play. More on that...\n\n* Athleticism: Jahlil Okafor is not a good athlete. He's really slow, a really bad leaper and isn't as strong as you think. He's looked way worse in this regard since the meniscus tear he suffered at the end of his rookie year (which he is struggling with to this day). His conditioning is also terrible. He's out of breath in like 2 minutes every time.  Another important thing to consider is that teams can easily deny him the ball if they want because he's not big or strong enough to reliably carve out position.  If the team runs a play to get him a post up and he ends up getting the ball 18 feet from the hoop, the possession is already wasted because he's not passing it out.\n\n* Effort: Jahlil Okafor doesn't care. This is his least redeemable quality. He doesn't try on defense or even pretend to, and he doesn't try on offense unless the ball is in his hands, and even then he sometimes takes the lazy way out with a contested fall away jumper that never goes in instead of taking it strong to the rack. This is why I never felt that bad for him when he was complaining about the playing time. If it was Richaun that was complaining about being buried on the roster (which he was without complaint despite being a blatantly better player), I would be sympathetic because that dude gives it everything he's got every time he's on the floor. Jahlil blatantly didn't give a shit when he was on the floor at times. If he can't put forth the effort in games, why should I believe that he's putting forth the effort in practice?\n\n* Impact. Jahlil Okafor ALWAYS makes the team worse. It's worth mentioning that in the NBA, his teams have been way better with him off the court. Think about this: during Jahlil's rookie season, the 2015-16 76ers (who were one of the worst teams of all time by record and had no scorers apart from him) were WAY worse on both sides of the ball when he was on the floor. Some fans argue that his contribution was the primary reason that team was historically bad rather than normal bad, since they had the point differential of a ~25 win team with him off the court (they won 10 games).  This is the very same season that people point to and say \"He averaged 17.5 ppg on 50% shooting as a rookie.  He can play\".  His on off numbers were even worse last year in the limited time he was on the floor.  Even in college, his team was way better with him off the court (Duke fans called it the Okafor effect), and Coach K cut Jah's minutes in the tournament when he was getting exploited.  When you think critically about the weaknesses above, it becomes clear why he's a negative player.  You need to make him the primary option on offense for it to be worthwhile to have his defense on the floor, but this slows down the offense to a crawl and often leads to bad shots with little time left on the shot clock after the initial play to set up a post up fails, not to mention the turnover risk of feeding him in the post when he can't manage to carve out positioning (these don't show up on his stat sheet).  Also, it's widely accepted that getting everyone involved on offense brings the team together and elevates play on both ends (Steve Kerr and Phil Jackson preach this hard).  Jahlil has the counter effect.  His teammates were forced to watch him not try on defense, then on offense the team ran elaborate plays just for the right to throw it to Jahlil in the post only for him to eventually jack a bad shot without looking for the wide open shooter in the corner.\n\nTo be fair here, I will mention his strengths:\n\n*STRENGTHS*\n\n* Touch: Jahlil Okafor has elite touch within a couple feet of the rim. He makes more twirling floaters than you would think. This is his best skill.\n\n* Footwork: Jahlil Okafor has very good footwork to make his way to the basket despite the fact that the defense knows that's what he wants to do. He can operate in faceup situations just as effectively as post ups. Related: He has a really good spin move which is way faster and more nimble than anything that you would think he'd be able to do.\n\n* Rim Protection (kind of): Jahlil Okafor is slightly better than you would think at rim protection thank you may think. When he is in position, it's tough to finish through him because he has a big body with good length. As I mentioned before however, he's terrible at getting into position so he rarely gets to show this.\n\n\nIf you ask me how I think his time with the Nets will go, I think Jahlil may put up some empty stats and some people will laugh at the 76ers because the Nets got him for free, but it won't change his insurmountable flaws. I also think he's an especially bad fit for the Nets who are looking to play extremely fast with an egalitarian offense, and I highly doubt he's wearing a Nets uniform next season."}, {"id": "dqyx7pz", "body": "[Serious]  I think he'll be a terrible player for the Nets because I truly think he's always been deeply flawed to the point that he needs multiple major developments as a player to even become roster worthy on a playoff team.
