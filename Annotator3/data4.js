Also a big part of Westbrook's play style last year involved giving Oladipo (and other players) open 3s on the perimeter (because he was so good at penetrating), but Oladipo was only able to hit 36% from 3 (a career high at that point).  Then all of a sudden this year he is taking a ton of pullup 3s and is hitting 44.4% and everyone acts like Westbrook was holding him back from being this Steph Curry level shooter.  It's ridiculous.

Usually some role players make the top of the list, because their +/- stats are surprisingly good. Among the many weird results, there\u2019s one that made no sense to me. Cousins being 5th and AD being 10th.\n\nCousins was a monster at the beginning of the season. His stats were top-3 in the league and his NetRtg also reflected how good he was (leader of his team). As a result, he was top-3 in pretty much every advanced stat including RPM. But since then he has regressed significantly. Both his scoring and TS% have taken a hit, while he still averages 5+ turnovers per game.\n\nBack to the AD comparison. Right now AD is comfortably ahead in PER and WS, so it\u2019s safe to say that his counting stats are better. One would expect that Cousins does other things that don\u2019t show up in the stat sheet and his +/- stats would show it. But no. Right now the Pelicans\u2019 NetRtg with AD on the floor is 5.2, best in the team (excluding Cooke, who has played 5 minutes total). When he\u2019s on the bench their NetRtg drops to an awful -12.7. As for Cousins, the Pelicans have a -0.6 NetRtg with him on the floor and a +0.8(!) when he\u2019s on the bench.\n\nAll things considered, can someone explain how is this possible?
