This would help the player immediately earn a professional contract, as well as a stable culture and lifestyle bridge into the NBA.\n\n2) A reduction in games per season: I would like to see the NBA season at 66 games a year, over the same time frame as the current schedule. From thesportsquotient.com, \"Each team would play every team in the opposing conference twice (one at home and one on the road) to total 30 games. Additionally, each team would then play the other 14 teams in their own conference twice (one home and one road) to bring the total to 58 games. Lastly, each team would play the other four teams in their division two more times (one home and one road) to bring the regular season total to 66 games.\" This would increase the importance of games, the quality of games (with increased recovery and practice time), increase the travel time, and increase the competitive rivalry with divisions.\n\nWhat are your two rules/policies?

Now that it's been a while I thought I'd post the stats again so you can see how they all stack up now. I'm not gonna add anything on to the numbers because I don't want to come off as biased, I'm just gonna put the numbers. \n\n(Note, I chose these PGs because they're typically seen in the same tier and are interchangeable in rankings. Most rankings will have Curry, Russ, and CP3 as the top 3 followed by these 7)\n\nKyrie (24 Games) : 24/3/5 on 59 TS%, 25 PER\n\nDame (24 Games): 26/5/6 on 57 TS%, 24 PER\n\nWall (16 Games): 20/3/9 on 53 TS%, 21 PER\n\nLowry (22 Games): 17/6/7 on 63 TS%, 20 PER\n\nKemba (20 Games): 23/4/6 on 58 TS%, 22 PER\n\nConley and IT would be in this tier also, but they currently have injury issues. \n\n\nI think all this shows is just how close all of these PGs are. Dame and Kyrie will give you elite scoring and solid playmaking. Wall is a very good playmaker. Lowry can do a little bit of everything. Kemba as well. \n\nOverall all of these guys are having solid years, excited to look back in another month and see what's changed. \n"}, {"id": "dqutsnr", "body": "where's westbrook"}, {"id": "dqutsnr", "body": "where's westbrook"}, {"id": "dqutwe9", "body": "&gt; (Note, I chose these PGs because they're typically seen in the same tier and are interchangeable in rankings.
