I think they have to go all in on Lebron.\n\n\n**Why the Cavs do it:** They\u2019re on huge contracts, but both have regressed. JR Smith is putting up under 8 points per game on 36% from 3 and Tristan Thompson is putting up 4/4 and playing like a DLeague player. Iman Shumpert is constantly injured, and when he does play, he\u2019s not much better than Cameron Payne. Channing Frye is shooting under 32% from 3. \n\nThe Cavs get a great defensive center in DJ, and two lights out shooters this season, both who can create off the dribble (JJ more so). Yes, the Nets pick is valuable, but if the Cavs lose the championship and Lebron leaves, their own picks will be just as valuable.\n\n**Why the Clippers do it:** DeAndre is an UFA if he opts out this summer (he will) and they can likely lose him for nothing. Taking on TT\u2019s bad contract and getting a likely top 7 pick in addition with their own top 10 pick will be great for rebuilding.\n\n**Why the Knicks do it:**Courtney Lee and JR are on nearly identical contracts, JR getting $2 million more per year. JR would be fun to have in NY, him being a former player there and a native of the area. They also get a future pick from the Clippers (some protection probably needed for LAC) that will come at the tail end of a tank job. LA trades the pick because the Nets pick is way more valuable than DJ, especially if they\u2019re not taking Shumpert.\n\n**Why the Sixers do it:** Redick isn\u2019t part of this long term plans, anyway. They only signed him to meet the cap floor. Channing is expiring, Shumpert isn\u2019t going to hinder any championship goals in this year or next (they\u2019re not even making the playoffs this year), and Cedi a nice rookie that fits their timeline that will get a chance to actually play for them. The Cavs 2020 pick swap is a bet that Lebron will leave, but they won\u2019t be so bad as to be a bottom 8 team in the league. \n\nIt\u2019s a decent bet, but not that risky for either team. The Cavs probably won\u2019t be that much worse than the Sixers in 2020, even if Lebron leaves.
