Russ brings more passion, intensity, defensive upside, and midrange game (perhaps less efficient due to volume, but far more consistent, which is important for not being so easy to slow down scheme-wise in the playoffs a la Spurs series) and is better at playing above the rim... he brings comparable driving and shot creation, comparable distribution skills, comparable foul drawing ability, comparable handle (less flashy but still uses it to great effect)... worse volume 3 point shooting. It's certainly reasonable to choose either of them over the other even if a lot of this thread thinks it's no context. \n\nHarden has had five + seasons for his GM to build around him while Westbrook has had a little over one since Durant left and created a gaping hole in a roster that was designed more around a him than Russ to start with.
