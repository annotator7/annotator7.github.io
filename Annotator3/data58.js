This also happens to be the type of shots Boogie doesn't, or rarely uses. Overall whenever he tries to bully his way into the rim, he tends to ignore the proximity of the opponents' hands on the ball and sometimes even tries to dribble into traffic, and I dont think he has a very savvy a post game as people think he does.\n\nhttps://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/couside01.html\n\nAccording to his 2017-2018 Play-by-Play, by the time I posted this, 90 of his turnovers are from losing the ball or other offensive fouls, whereas 58 are from bad passes. If he can somehow get a floater/hook shot game and limit bullying his way to the rim unless he has a clear plan, I think he can cut down on most of those ball-handling-related turnovers \n\ntl;dr just needs 2 extra post moves in his arsenal, and limit bullyball"}, {"id": "drc0saa", "body": "How do you know they dont call out double teams lol"}, {"id": "drc0saa", "body": "How do you know they dont call out double teams lol"}, {"id": "drc0yxn", "body": "I never said that lol"}, {"id": "drc0yxn", "body": "I never said that lol"}, {"id": "drc4ttu", "body": "I meant to say that in response to another commenter"}, {"id": "drc4ttu", "body": "I meant to say that in response to another commenter"}, {"id": "drc5924", "body": "Yeah lol mb"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7l2jcy", "body": "For example Lonzo is missing a reliable jumper what's one thing a player could add to elevate themselves into a superstar?"}, {"id": "driyqqd", "body": "Ricky Rubio is also missing a jumpshot."}, {"id": "driyqqd", "body": "Ricky Rubio is also missing a jumpshot."}, {"id": "drizdnx", "body": "and MKG and Michael Carter Williams and Justice Winslow and Rondo and ..."}, {"id": "drizdnx", "body": "and MKG and Michael Carter Williams and Justice Winslow and Rondo and ..."}, {"id": "drizsqp", "body": "MKG would be better but not a superstar.
