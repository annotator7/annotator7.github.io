KD and Klay have put the team on their back and beasted. Casspi and West's have a beautiful chemistry developing. The bench actually looks better than last year. For this period Warriors have lucked out with the schedule given their current injury status, this early afternoon games versus the Cavs will be a good test.\n2\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-1\t|\t25-6\t|\tHouston's winning streak came to a sudden halt with back to back losses in Los Angeles, despite Harden's back-to-back 50 point outings, but with the Warriors losing as well, Houston stays on top of the league in terms of record. With Chris Paul and Clint Capela day-to-day, there's some obvious gaps in the offense and defense that the Rockets are struggling to figure out. Expect the team to get back to their winning ways when they're able to roll out a healthy squad once again.\n3\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+1\t|\t24-9\t|\tCavs have continued to squeak out wins. I wouldn't call them very impressive wins but hey are getting the job done. January's schedule picks up and we should see what this team is all about.\n4\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t+2\t|\t23-8\t|\tDerozan made more 3s than the Warriors in a game this week, my life is complete\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t-2\t|\t27-9\t|\tLast power rankings I said if the Celtics went 5-3 over this stretch of games I would consider it a massive success. They did slightly worse, going .500. But when you play 8 games in 12 days, you take whatever you can get. The Celtics get a slight relief in their upcoming schedule though, with *only* 7 games over the course of 13 days, including two back-to-backs. Matchups against the Rockets, Cavs, and Timberwolves will define this stretch of upcoming games, but due to how the schedule is laid out and recent nagging injuries to key players, if they go 1-2 it'll be considered a massive success. Over the course of the next 7 games if they can go 4-3, I'll consider it a success. By New Years, the Celtics will have played 5 more games than anyone else in the Eastern Conference. That London game on January 11th will finally provide the Celtics will some relief in scheduling though, giving them 5 days of rest both before and after that matchup.\n6\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t-1\t|\t23-11\t|\tThe Spurs have gone 1-4 in games that Kawhi\u2019s played in since his return. #NotMyMVP. But in all seriousness, the team has appeared to be in a funk as of late, some of which could be attributed to the team\u2019s star player\u2019s return, and subsequent struggle to reintegrate into the flow of an NBA schedule. However, Kawhi has yet to play more than 20 minutes in one game since his return, and definitely seems to be shaking off a bit of rust as he and the rest of the roster gain a level of comfort playing with one another again. The team still looks solidly locked in to a Top-3 seed in the West however, and if the team can find a rhythm now that the full roster is at Pop\u2019s disposal again, we could threaten the Rockets and Warriors come playoff time.\n7\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t--\t|\t20-13\t|\tWolves got through the easiest part of their schedule with 20 wins which is a present itself this holiday season, the challenge is they face the hardest schedule the rest of the season. The team will need Jimmy Butler to continue to drag this team to victory.\n9\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t--\t|\t19-14\t|\tOver the last two weeks, the Pacers have further solidified their position in the playoff race. Victor Oladipo's All-Star campaign grows in strength every game, as he has averaged over 28 points over the previous six games. After Christmas, Indiana faces Detroit in a game with playoff tiebreaker implications. \n9\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t+9\t|\t18-15\t|\tOKC have surged over the last ranking period, being 8-2. The defence continues to be absolutely miserly, as the combination of Andre Roberson and Paul George (who is really running away with DPOY) have absolutely locked down the star wings they face. The offence has also been improving: given that they never worked on it in camp, it's reasonable to see them going through growing pains. Many of r/nba's complaints have been worked on; Melo has improved his screens, Russ has been moving off ball. The biggest difference though, is the play of Russell Westbrook. MVPbrook is back, and has been carrying the team to wins on some clutch 4th quarters of great effeciency. Russell is also playing the best defence of his career, as him and PG13 lead the league in steals. The game tonight vs the Rockets will be a great litmus test to see how far this team has really come since October.\n10\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t+1\t|\t18-15\t|\tConcerns were arising after two tough losses to OKC and Minnesota, namely if this team could mature enough to close out games against talented opponents. The Nuggets answered back in spectacular fashion, with quality wins on a back-to-back in Portland and Oakland. G-Leaguer Torrey Craig has emerged as a stud on the defensive end, and the dreaded Jokic-Plumlee lineups that were deployed with limited success earlier in the season seem to be much more effective now, as Plumlee seems to have hit his stride lately (9 pts, 9 reb, 2 blk in 27 mins per game).\n11\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t-3\t|\t17-14\t|\tJason Kidd still needs to be fired. Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton have legitimate cases for making the All-Star roster. Our Greek continutes to be a freak and deserves more DPoY hype than he's been receiving. Mirza's season or even career might be over and that really sucks. Did I mention Jason Kidd should be fired?\n12\t|\t[](/DET) Pistons\t|\t+1\t|\t18-14\t|\tAfter a brutal stretch of schedule where the Pistons went on a 7 game losing streak, the Pistons have bounced back by winning 4 of 5 against more forgiving competition. It has not always looked pretty recently, Tobias Harris and Reggie Jackson have struggled and Avery Bradley is hurt. But Andre Drummond is still dominating on a nightly basis and the Pistons have weathered the toughest stretch of their schedule and are still right where they want to be.\n13\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t-3\t|\t18-15\t|\tJohn Wall has returned to the lineup after a 9 game hiatus but still looks clearly bothered by his knee which is affecting his play. This team has looked complacent on most nights often blowing leads and underperforming. Bradley Beal has been nothing short of inconsistent thus far already registering a 51 point game and a 4 point game (2-15 FG in 29 Min). At this point you're wondering how this team could possibly be 18-15 with a basic Scott Brooks offense and the two all-stars underperforming. Credit Mike Scott who has been worth every penny of his 1.7M contract that David Wallace refused to pay him. He's currently 6th in the entire NBA in FG% and has been keeping the team afloat and fans hopeful. He deserves all of the rolexes and gucci bags for his performance that we hope he can keep up in the new year while everyone else tries to get their heads out of the place where the sun don't shine.\n14\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Pels have been so inconsistent, yet somehow still strangely consistent? Their turnover issues have caused them to lose so many games. When they turn it over less than 15 times in a game, they are 11-4 this season. Their defense has struggled heavily as well (mainly because of points off of those turnovers). But their offense is still incredibly elite. Top 5 in scoring on the season, top 5 shooting beyond the arc, and since Rondo returned they have 3 20 point scores (AD, Boogie, Jrue) and another 15 point scorer (E'twaun). Everything is clicking on offense finally, but the defense has to shape up. For now the struggles are holding them back. \n15\t|\t[](/POR) Trailblazers\t|\t-3\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Mo Harkless revolution is upon us now. With Lillard sitting out back to back games Mo stepped up to make a case for the starting line up.\n16\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+1\t|\t17-15\t|\tporzingis back and making better decision, but his shot is off, hardaway hurt, kanter a refugee, lee relative slump, jack surprises in midrange, and as passer, baker good defense, ntilikina develops, found his shot, o'quinn is jewish. MICHAEL BEASLEY! jeff hornacek gets credit for strong chemistry, strong systemic play on both ends. we need more talent, but this team is lovely.\n17\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t+2\t|\t17-16\t|\tBoston got maple-dicked and we're only one game out of the 4th place in the East. Injuries have been heavy and we saw some minutes from rookie point guard Derrick Walton Jr who one /r/Heat subscriber dubbed Gremlin Justise Winslow. Josh Richardson is still doing well, Dion Waiters is not too consistent but he does his best. Oh yeah Erik Spoelstra passed Pat Riley for franchise wins as the Head Coach! It was the game that brought us back to .500 too so it was extra sweet. \n18\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t-2\t|\t15-19\t|\tDonovan Mitchell is the real deal. It looked like Melo and Russ graced him after the game.  jJazz are still heavily reliant on Goberts play but are in the hunt.\n19\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t-4\t|\t14-18\t|\tSo... how is everyone's December going? Mine is going... bad. The Sixers are really struggling. Already on a downslide, the 76ers took on OKC in a 3OT thriller that left Joel Embiid sidelined for a bit and questionable in a number of games afterward. There is very little depth at the wings and at the guard position. Very few players can dribble. Like.. I miss Justin Anderson's acumen with the ball in his hands, and Justin Anderson plays like he's dribbling a greased ham. Merry Christmas everyone. Pray for better days and Fultz's return. \n20\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t+3\t|\t13-19\t|\tWell, I guess the Clippers were on the naughty list this year, because all Clippers fans have received are Lou Williams and Austin Rivers chucking shots, which I can only assume is the basketball equivalent of coal. Still, there can be no complaints, because the team actually sort of looks competitive every game. Much of the team's relative success can be attributed to the bench, whose hustle makes Santa's feat of visiting every child look pedestrian by comparison. And with news that Blake's return is imminent, it looks as though Christmas came pretty much on time this year.\n21\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t-1\t|\t12-20\t|\tThe Brooklyn Nets are 2nd in the NBA in 3PA while also shooting 28th in 3PT%. So it's clear what they WANT to do but it's been a struggle getting the players to actually do it. On a positive note, it seems Okafor and D'Lo are both around 2 weeks away from returning to playing which will be an exciting return for everyone. The Nets are missing D'Lo's 4th quarter scoring and have lost in multiple close game situations as the game slows down. Will be interesting to see D'Lo/Dinwiddie starting together with LeVert running the bench unit. \n22\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t-1\t|\t11-20\t|\tFinishing our roughest stretch of the season, Lakers proved that they can compete with the best of them. Then they go out and remind us that they're young and will lose all intensity, losing to a Lillard-less Blazers. Lonzo is getting better and better while Kuzma is showing that he's got the tools to be a scorer in the league. \n24\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t--\t|\t12-21\t|\tThis stretch was technically an improvement over losing to the Bulls and Lakers in back to back games at home, but at this point, for the Hornets to take a meaningful seed, it would take a borderline miracle.  However, MKG is starting to get back a somewhat high level of play, increasing all of points, rebounds, assists, and efficiency, which will be vital to that miracle should it end up happening.\n24\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t+6\t|\t10-22\t|\tA hot streak from the returning Niko Mirotic, combined with solid production out of Kris Dunn, sparked a 7 game win streak during a home-heavy section of the Bulls' schedule. Niko is the team's leading scorer, rebounder &amp; 3PT shooter since returning to the lineup. Added offense should be a relief for Lauri Markkanen, whose hot career start went ice cold in the past few weeks. The rookie has cooled way off on efficiency but has still found occasional bursts of offense, as he did against the Cavs. At the time of winning their 7th consecutive game, the Bulls were still 11 games under .500. So despite the occasional bright spots, expect many more losses. Though the upside Markkanen, Dunn &amp; other young players are showing will make those losses more bearable.\n25\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t+1\t|\t12-23\t|\tThese past two weeks have been interesting for the Suns - after Booker got injured in the loss to Toronto, the Suns dropped 4 straight. In what seemed to be a move to put the tank in overdrive, the Suns signed Isaiah Canaan aaaand accidently won 3 of their last 4. Canaan has probably been the best player in a Suns uniform during his time with PHX, averaging 13/5/4 in 25 mpg. After losing a couple key tank battles against Dallas and Memphis, the Suns sit an awkard 7th on the Tankathon rankings but hopefully in the perfect spot to draft Trae Young. \n26\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t+1\t|\t11-21\t|\tThe Kings have shown some positives as of late.WCS has played well and Buddy Hield shows why he\u2019s the 3rd option of the future.George Hill and Zach Randolph have both been showcasing their trade value as of late and the kings are 4-6 in their last 10 so the tank is in danger.Stay Tuned\n27\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t-5\t|\t11-23\t|\tWe suck, like a lot. We start off somewhat decent but completely implode as the game progresses. Oh, and let's not forget about the injuries, with Vucevic out for the next two months on top of already having Gordon, Fournier, Ross and Isaac out for extended periods of time. At least Payton got a career high 30 points against the Wizards right?\n28\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-3\t|\t10-23\t|\tAfter a win against the Clippers that feels like a Christmas present, Grizzlies fans must admit that the team is nowhere near out of the woods yet. Memphis has notched 3 wins in their last 20 games, and often looks like the least coordinated, most identity-less team in the NBA. The schedule eases up a little bit from here, but the Grizzlies still look bad as everyone wonders what will happen when Mike Conley returns.\n29\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-1\t|\t9-25\t|\tDennis Smith has been hurt, which was expected to hurt the tank and help get more wins. Instead, the Mavs only won twice since the last power rankings. Dirk has been finding his touch, as he is shooting 44% from 3 over the last 2 weeks. The emergence of Maxi Kleber continues to be a great storyline in Dallas, and the turn around of a season Dwight Powell is having is remarkable. JJ Barea and Yogi may be father and son, the same way Maxi is most definitely Dirk's son. It's been a hell of a ride so far, and it's only been 2 months of the season, but watching the young guys on this roster develop is a welcome sight. The Mavericks have a brutal schedule before the next rankings, and Derek Harper is getting his number retired against the Knicks on January 7. Fun fact: The Mavs lead the NBA in DRTG in wins (9 game sample size). So we have that going for us.\n30\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t-1\t|\t8-25\t|\tThe Hawks have at minimum been competitive. Really a perfect tank if you ask me.

KD and Klay have put the team on their back and beasted. Casspi and West's have a beautiful chemistry developing. The bench actually looks better than last year. For this period Warriors have lucked out with the schedule given their current injury status, this early afternoon games versus the Cavs will be a good test.\n2\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-1\t|\t25-6\t|\tHouston's winning streak came to a sudden halt with back to back losses in Los Angeles, despite Harden's back-to-back 50 point outings, but with the Warriors losing as well, Houston stays on top of the league in terms of record. With Chris Paul and Clint Capela day-to-day, there's some obvious gaps in the offense and defense that the Rockets are struggling to figure out. Expect the team to get back to their winning ways when they're able to roll out a healthy squad once again.\n3\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+1\t|\t24-9\t|\tCavs have continued to squeak out wins. I wouldn't call them very impressive wins but hey are getting the job done. January's schedule picks up and we should see what this team is all about.\n4\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t+2\t|\t23-8\t|\tDerozan made more 3s than the Warriors in a game this week, my life is complete\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t-2\t|\t27-9\t|\tLast power rankings I said if the Celtics went 5-3 over this stretch of games I would consider it a massive success. They did slightly worse, going .500. But when you play 8 games in 12 days, you take whatever you can get. The Celtics get a slight relief in their upcoming schedule though, with *only* 7 games over the course of 13 days, including two back-to-backs. Matchups against the Rockets, Cavs, and Timberwolves will define this stretch of upcoming games, but due to how the schedule is laid out and recent nagging injuries to key players, if they go 1-2 it'll be considered a massive success. Over the course of the next 7 games if they can go 4-3, I'll consider it a success. By New Years, the Celtics will have played 5 more games than anyone else in the Eastern Conference. That London game on January 11th will finally provide the Celtics will some relief in scheduling though, giving them 5 days of rest both before and after that matchup.\n6\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t-1\t|\t23-11\t|\tThe Spurs have gone 1-4 in games that Kawhi\u2019s played in since his return. #NotMyMVP. But in all seriousness, the team has appeared to be in a funk as of late, some of which could be attributed to the team\u2019s star player\u2019s return, and subsequent struggle to reintegrate into the flow of an NBA schedule. However, Kawhi has yet to play more than 20 minutes in one game since his return, and definitely seems to be shaking off a bit of rust as he and the rest of the roster gain a level of comfort playing with one another again. The team still looks solidly locked in to a Top-3 seed in the West however, and if the team can find a rhythm now that the full roster is at Pop\u2019s disposal again, we could threaten the Rockets and Warriors come playoff time.\n7\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t--\t|\t20-13\t|\tWolves got through the easiest part of their schedule with 20 wins which is a present itself this holiday season, the challenge is they face the hardest schedule the rest of the season. The team will need Jimmy Butler to continue to drag this team to victory.\n9\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t--\t|\t19-14\t|\tOver the last two weeks, the Pacers have further solidified their position in the playoff race. Victor Oladipo's All-Star campaign grows in strength every game, as he has averaged over 28 points over the previous six games. After Christmas, Indiana faces Detroit in a game with playoff tiebreaker implications. \n9\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t+9\t|\t18-15\t|\tOKC have surged over the last ranking period, being 8-2. The defence continues to be absolutely miserly, as the combination of Andre Roberson and Paul George (who is really running away with DPOY) have absolutely locked down the star wings they face. The offence has also been improving: given that they never worked on it in camp, it's reasonable to see them going through growing pains. Many of r/nba's complaints have been worked on; Melo has improved his screens, Russ has been moving off ball. The biggest difference though, is the play of Russell Westbrook. MVPbrook is back, and has been carrying the team to wins on some clutch 4th quarters of great effeciency. Russell is also playing the best defence of his career, as him and PG13 lead the league in steals. The game tonight vs the Rockets will be a great litmus test to see how far this team has really come since October.\n10\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t+1\t|\t18-15\t|\tConcerns were arising after two tough losses to OKC and Minnesota, namely if this team could mature enough to close out games against talented opponents. The Nuggets answered back in spectacular fashion, with quality wins on a back-to-back in Portland and Oakland. G-Leaguer Torrey Craig has emerged as a stud on the defensive end, and the dreaded Jokic-Plumlee lineups that were deployed with limited success earlier in the season seem to be much more effective now, as Plumlee seems to have hit his stride lately (9 pts, 9 reb, 2 blk in 27 mins per game).\n11\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t-3\t|\t17-14\t|\tJason Kidd still needs to be fired. Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton have legitimate cases for making the All-Star roster. Our Greek continutes to be a freak and deserves more DPoY hype than he's been receiving. Mirza's season or even career might be over and that really sucks. Did I mention Jason Kidd should be fired?\n12\t|\t[](/DET) Pistons\t|\t+1\t|\t18-14\t|\tAfter a brutal stretch of schedule where the Pistons went on a 7 game losing streak, the Pistons have bounced back by winning 4 of 5 against more forgiving competition. It has not always looked pretty recently, Tobias Harris and Reggie Jackson have struggled and Avery Bradley is hurt. But Andre Drummond is still dominating on a nightly basis and the Pistons have weathered the toughest stretch of their schedule and are still right where they want to be.\n13\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t-3\t|\t18-15\t|\tJohn Wall has returned to the lineup after a 9 game hiatus but still looks clearly bothered by his knee which is affecting his play. This team has looked complacent on most nights often blowing leads and underperforming. Bradley Beal has been nothing short of inconsistent thus far already registering a 51 point game and a 4 point game (2-15 FG in 29 Min). At this point you're wondering how this team could possibly be 18-15 with a basic Scott Brooks offense and the two all-stars underperforming. Credit Mike Scott who has been worth every penny of his 1.7M contract that David Wallace refused to pay him. He's currently 6th in the entire NBA in FG% and has been keeping the team afloat and fans hopeful. He deserves all of the rolexes and gucci bags for his performance that we hope he can keep up in the new year while everyone else tries to get their heads out of the place where the sun don't shine.\n14\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Pels have been so inconsistent, yet somehow still strangely consistent? Their turnover issues have caused them to lose so many games. When they turn it over less than 15 times in a game, they are 11-4 this season. Their defense has struggled heavily as well (mainly because of points off of those turnovers). But their offense is still incredibly elite. Top 5 in scoring on the season, top 5 shooting beyond the arc, and since Rondo returned they have 3 20 point scores (AD, Boogie, Jrue) and another 15 point scorer (E'twaun). Everything is clicking on offense finally, but the defense has to shape up. For now the struggles are holding them back. \n15\t|\t[](/POR) Trailblazers\t|\t-3\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Mo Harkless revolution is upon us now. With Lillard sitting out back to back games Mo stepped up to make a case for the starting line up.\n16\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+1\t|\t17-15\t|\tporzingis back and making better decision, but his shot is off, hardaway hurt, kanter a refugee, lee relative slump, jack surprises in midrange, and as passer, baker good defense, ntilikina develops, found his shot, o'quinn is jewish. MICHAEL BEASLEY! jeff hornacek gets credit for strong chemistry, strong systemic play on both ends. we need more talent, but this team is lovely.\n17\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t+2\t|\t17-16\t|\tBoston got maple-dicked and we're only one game out of the 4th place in the East. Injuries have been heavy and we saw some minutes from rookie point guard Derrick Walton Jr who one /r/Heat subscriber dubbed Gremlin Justise Winslow. Josh Richardson is still doing well, Dion Waiters is not too consistent but he does his best. Oh yeah Erik Spoelstra passed Pat Riley for franchise wins as the Head Coach! It was the game that brought us back to .500 too so it was extra sweet. \n18\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t-2\t|\t15-19\t|\tDonovan Mitchell is the real deal. It looked like Melo and Russ graced him after the game.  jJazz are still heavily reliant on Goberts play but are in the hunt.\n19\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t-4\t|\t14-18\t|\tSo... how is everyone's December going?

Other than that we rank the teams the same way as our competition.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\\#\t|\tTeam\t|\t\u0394\t|\tRecord\t|\tComment\n--: \t|\t:--\t|\t:--\t|\t:-:\t|\t:--\n1\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t+1\t|\t26-7\t|\tKerr has been tinkering with the line up and seeing how many players can be removed before the Warriors lose a game. KD and Klay have put the team on their back and beasted. Casspi and West's have a beautiful chemistry developing. The bench actually looks better than last year. For this period Warriors have lucked out with the schedule given their current injury status, this early afternoon games versus the Cavs will be a good test.\n2\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-1\t|\t25-6\t|\tHouston's winning streak came to a sudden halt with back to back losses in Los Angeles, despite Harden's back-to-back 50 point outings, but with the Warriors losing as well, Houston stays on top of the league in terms of record. With Chris Paul and Clint Capela day-to-day, there's some obvious gaps in the offense and defense that the Rockets are struggling to figure out. Expect the team to get back to their winning ways when they're able to roll out a healthy squad once again.\n3\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t+1\t|\t24-9\t|\tCavs have continued to squeak out wins. I wouldn't call them very impressive wins but hey are getting the job done. January's schedule picks up and we should see what this team is all about.\n4\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t+2\t|\t23-8\t|\tDerozan made more 3s than the Warriors in a game this week, my life is complete\n5\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t-2\t|\t27-9\t|\tLast power rankings I said if the Celtics went 5-3 over this stretch of games I would consider it a massive success. They did slightly worse, going .500. But when you play 8 games in 12 days, you take whatever you can get. The Celtics get a slight relief in their upcoming schedule though, with *only* 7 games over the course of 13 days, including two back-to-backs. Matchups against the Rockets, Cavs, and Timberwolves will define this stretch of upcoming games, but due to how the schedule is laid out and recent nagging injuries to key players, if they go 1-2 it'll be considered a massive success. Over the course of the next 7 games if they can go 4-3, I'll consider it a success. By New Years, the Celtics will have played 5 more games than anyone else in the Eastern Conference. That London game on January 11th will finally provide the Celtics will some relief in scheduling though, giving them 5 days of rest both before and after that matchup.\n6\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t-1\t|\t23-11\t|\tThe Spurs have gone 1-4 in games that Kawhi\u2019s played in since his return. #NotMyMVP. But in all seriousness, the team has appeared to be in a funk as of late, some of which could be attributed to the team\u2019s star player\u2019s return, and subsequent struggle to reintegrate into the flow of an NBA schedule. However, Kawhi has yet to play more than 20 minutes in one game since his return, and definitely seems to be shaking off a bit of rust as he and the rest of the roster gain a level of comfort playing with one another again. The team still looks solidly locked in to a Top-3 seed in the West however, and if the team can find a rhythm now that the full roster is at Pop\u2019s disposal again, we could threaten the Rockets and Warriors come playoff time.\n7\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t--\t|\t20-13\t|\tWolves got through the easiest part of their schedule with 20 wins which is a present itself this holiday season, the challenge is they face the hardest schedule the rest of the season. The team will need Jimmy Butler to continue to drag this team to victory.\n9\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t--\t|\t19-14\t|\tOver the last two weeks, the Pacers have further solidified their position in the playoff race. Victor Oladipo's All-Star campaign grows in strength every game, as he has averaged over 28 points over the previous six games. After Christmas, Indiana faces Detroit in a game with playoff tiebreaker implications. \n9\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t+9\t|\t18-15\t|\tOKC have surged over the last ranking period, being 8-2. The defence continues to be absolutely miserly, as the combination of Andre Roberson and Paul George (who is really running away with DPOY) have absolutely locked down the star wings they face. The offence has also been improving: given that they never worked on it in camp, it's reasonable to see them going through growing pains. Many of r/nba's complaints have been worked on; Melo has improved his screens, Russ has been moving off ball. The biggest difference though, is the play of Russell Westbrook. MVPbrook is back, and has been carrying the team to wins on some clutch 4th quarters of great effeciency. Russell is also playing the best defence of his career, as him and PG13 lead the league in steals. The game tonight vs the Rockets will be a great litmus test to see how far this team has really come since October.\n10\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t+1\t|\t18-15\t|\tConcerns were arising after two tough losses to OKC and Minnesota, namely if this team could mature enough to close out games against talented opponents. The Nuggets answered back in spectacular fashion, with quality wins on a back-to-back in Portland and Oakland. G-Leaguer Torrey Craig has emerged as a stud on the defensive end, and the dreaded Jokic-Plumlee lineups that were deployed with limited success earlier in the season seem to be much more effective now, as Plumlee seems to have hit his stride lately (9 pts, 9 reb, 2 blk in 27 mins per game).\n11\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t-3\t|\t17-14\t|\tJason Kidd still needs to be fired. Eric Bledsoe and Khris Middleton have legitimate cases for making the All-Star roster. Our Greek continutes to be a freak and deserves more DPoY hype than he's been receiving. Mirza's season or even career might be over and that really sucks. Did I mention Jason Kidd should be fired?\n12\t|\t[](/DET) Pistons\t|\t+1\t|\t18-14\t|\tAfter a brutal stretch of schedule where the Pistons went on a 7 game losing streak, the Pistons have bounced back by winning 4 of 5 against more forgiving competition. It has not always looked pretty recently, Tobias Harris and Reggie Jackson have struggled and Avery Bradley is hurt. But Andre Drummond is still dominating on a nightly basis and the Pistons have weathered the toughest stretch of their schedule and are still right where they want to be.\n13\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t-3\t|\t18-15\t|\tJohn Wall has returned to the lineup after a 9 game hiatus but still looks clearly bothered by his knee which is affecting his play. This team has looked complacent on most nights often blowing leads and underperforming. Bradley Beal has been nothing short of inconsistent thus far already registering a 51 point game and a 4 point game (2-15 FG in 29 Min). At this point you're wondering how this team could possibly be 18-15 with a basic Scott Brooks offense and the two all-stars underperforming. Credit Mike Scott who has been worth every penny of his 1.7M contract that David Wallace refused to pay him. He's currently 6th in the entire NBA in FG% and has been keeping the team afloat and fans hopeful. He deserves all of the rolexes and gucci bags for his performance that we hope he can keep up in the new year while everyone else tries to get their heads out of the place where the sun don't shine.\n14\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Pels have been so inconsistent, yet somehow still strangely consistent? Their turnover issues have caused them to lose so many games. When they turn it over less than 15 times in a game, they are 11-4 this season. Their defense has struggled heavily as well (mainly because of points off of those turnovers). But their offense is still incredibly elite. Top 5 in scoring on the season, top 5 shooting beyond the arc, and since Rondo returned they have 3 20 point scores (AD, Boogie, Jrue) and another 15 point scorer (E'twaun). Everything is clicking on offense finally, but the defense has to shape up. For now the struggles are holding them back. \n15\t|\t[](/POR) Trailblazers\t|\t-3\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Mo Harkless revolution is upon us now. With Lillard sitting out back to back games Mo stepped up to make a case for the starting line up.\n16\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t+1\t|\t17-15\t|\tporzingis back and making better decision, but his shot is off, hardaway hurt, kanter a refugee, lee relative slump, jack surprises in midrange, and as passer, baker good defense, ntilikina develops, found his shot, o'quinn is jewish. MICHAEL BEASLEY! jeff hornacek gets credit for strong chemistry, strong systemic play on both ends. we need more talent, but this team is lovely.\n17\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t+2\t|\t17-16\t|\tBoston got maple-dicked and we're only one game out of the 4th place in the East. Injuries have been heavy and we saw some minutes from rookie point guard Derrick Walton Jr who one /r/Heat subscriber dubbed Gremlin Justise Winslow. Josh Richardson is still doing well, Dion Waiters is not too consistent but he does his best. Oh yeah Erik Spoelstra passed Pat Riley for franchise wins as the Head Coach! It was the game that brought us back to .500 too so it was extra sweet. \n18\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t-2\t|\t15-19\t|\tDonovan Mitchell is the real deal. It looked like Melo and Russ graced him after the game.  jJazz are still heavily reliant on Goberts play but are in the hunt.\n19\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t-4\t|\t14-18\t|\tSo... how is everyone's December going? Mine is going... bad. The Sixers are really struggling. Already on a downslide, the 76ers took on OKC in a 3OT thriller that left Joel Embiid sidelined for a bit and questionable in a number of games afterward. There is very little depth at the wings and at the guard position. Very few players can dribble. Like.. I miss Justin Anderson's acumen with the ball in his hands, and Justin Anderson plays like he's dribbling a greased ham. Merry Christmas everyone. Pray for better days and Fultz's return. \n20\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t+3\t|\t13-19\t|\tWell, I guess the Clippers were on the naughty list this year, because all Clippers fans have received are Lou Williams and Austin Rivers chucking shots, which I can only assume is the basketball equivalent of coal. Still, there can be no complaints, because the team actually sort of looks competitive every game. Much of the team's relative success can be attributed to the bench, whose hustle makes Santa's feat of visiting every child look pedestrian by comparison. And with news that Blake's return is imminent, it looks as though Christmas came pretty much on time this year.\n21\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t-1\t|\t12-20\t|\tThe Brooklyn Nets are 2nd in the NBA in 3PA while also shooting 28th in 3PT%. So it's clear what they WANT to do but it's been a struggle getting the players to actually do it. On a positive note, it seems Okafor and D'Lo are both around 2 weeks away from returning to playing which will be an exciting return for everyone. The Nets are missing D'Lo's 4th quarter scoring and have lost in multiple close game situations as the game slows down. Will be interesting to see D'Lo/Dinwiddie starting together with LeVert running the bench unit. \n22\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t-1\t|\t11-20\t|\tFinishing our roughest stretch of the season, Lakers proved that they can compete with the best of them. Then they go out and remind us that they're young and will lose all intensity, losing to a Lillard-less Blazers. Lonzo is getting better and better while Kuzma is showing that he's got the tools to be a scorer in the league. \n24\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t--\t|\t12-21\t|\tThis stretch was technically an improvement over losing to the Bulls and Lakers in back to back games at home, but at this point, for the Hornets to take a meaningful seed, it would take a borderline miracle.  However, MKG is starting to get back a somewhat high level of play, increasing all of points, rebounds, assists, and efficiency, which will be vital to that miracle should it end up happening.\n24\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t+6\t|\t10-22\t|\tA hot streak from the returning Niko Mirotic, combined with solid production out of Kris Dunn, sparked a 7 game win streak during a home-heavy section of the Bulls' schedule. Niko is the team's leading scorer, rebounder &amp; 3PT shooter since returning to the lineup. Added offense should be a relief for Lauri Markkanen, whose hot career start went ice cold in the past few weeks. The rookie has cooled way off on efficiency but has still found occasional bursts of offense, as he did against the Cavs. At the time of winning their 7th consecutive game, the Bulls were still 11 games under .500. So despite the occasional bright spots, expect many more losses. Though the upside Markkanen, Dunn &amp; other young players are showing will make those losses more bearable.\n25\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t+1\t|\t12-23\t|\tThese past two weeks have been interesting for the Suns - after Booker got injured in the loss to Toronto, the Suns dropped 4 straight. In what seemed to be a move to put the tank in overdrive, the Suns signed Isaiah Canaan aaaand accidently won 3 of their last 4. Canaan has probably been the best player in a Suns uniform during his time with PHX, averaging 13/5/4 in 25 mpg. After losing a couple key tank battles against Dallas and Memphis, the Suns sit an awkard 7th on the Tankathon rankings but hopefully in the perfect spot to draft Trae Young. \n26\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t+1\t|\t11-21\t|\tThe Kings have shown some positives as of late.WCS has played well and Buddy Hield shows why he\u2019s the 3rd option of the future.George Hill and Zach Randolph have both been showcasing their trade value as of late and the kings are 4-6 in their last 10 so the tank is in danger.Stay Tuned\n27\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t-5\t|\t11-23\t|\tWe suck, like a lot. We start off somewhat decent but completely implode as the game progresses. Oh, and let's not forget about the injuries, with Vucevic out for the next two months on top of already having Gordon, Fournier, Ross and Isaac out for extended periods of time. At least Payton got a career high 30 points against the Wizards right?\n28\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-3\t|\t10-23\t|\tAfter a win against the Clippers that feels like a Christmas present, Grizzlies fans must admit that the team is nowhere near out of the woods yet. Memphis has notched 3 wins in their last 20 games, and often looks like the least coordinated, most identity-less team in the NBA. The schedule eases up a little bit from here, but the Grizzlies still look bad as everyone wonders what will happen when Mike Conley returns.\n29\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-1\t|\t9-25\t|\tDennis Smith has been hurt, which was expected to hurt the tank and help get more wins. Instead, the Mavs only won twice since the last power rankings. Dirk has been finding his touch, as he is shooting 44% from 3 over the last 2 weeks. The emergence of Maxi Kleber continues to be a great storyline in Dallas, and the turn around of a season Dwight Powell is having is remarkable. JJ Barea and Yogi may be father and son, the same way Maxi is most definitely Dirk's son. It's been a hell of a ride so far, and it's only been 2 months of the season, but watching the young guys on this roster develop is a welcome sight. The Mavericks have a brutal schedule before the next rankings, and Derek Harper is getting his number retired against the Knicks on January 7. Fun fact: The Mavs lead the NBA in DRTG in wins (9 game sample size). So we have that going for us.\n30\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t-1\t|\t8-25\t|\tThe Hawks have at minimum been competitive.

As a big Spurs homer I used to argue Tony Parker&gt;Chris Paul because \"4 rings and finals MVP.\" But if you look at the circumstances it's definitely a plausible argument to rank CP3 over some of those players.\n\nCP3 could go over Stockton because he never played with a dominant player as good as the mailman. Blake Griffin has consistently failed to close games out in the 4th quarter and has dissipated when it counts the most. Mailman had choke-jobs too but he was a much superior player to Griffin. CP3 has very comparable/better numbers than Stockton. It's arguable.\n\nJason Kidd as great as he was played in the weak east in to get those finals appearances. He never would have went to the finals in the West (where CP3 has been his whole career). And that last finals appearance with Dirk he was a role player at that point in his career. Good on Kidd for making the finals, but context wise it's really unfair to argue it over CP3 since CP3 has been playing in a much superior conference over his career that featured prime spurs, Kobe-lakers, OKC, Warriors, etc. CP3 in the east his whole career would easily have multiple conference finals appearances (especially if he played in the east the last 4/5 years) and maybe even a finals appearance. \n\nSteve Nash benefited greatly from D'Antoni's system and those great rosters those Pheonix teams fielded. He definitely was the engine that made those teams go of course, but look at what CP3 is doing with D'Antoni now. Imagine if prime CP3 was running that system in Pheonix? He plays much better defense than Nash too. Also, one of Steve Nash's MVP's are always in debate even to this day. Could you imagine a player averaging 15/11 winning a MVP today? Definitely not. He probably wouldn't win his 19/10 MVP in today's era as well but I'd say he deserved that one. Either way, peak CP3 was arguably an MVP snub and is right up there with Nash. \n\nGary Payton...I think CP3 is clearly above him. He won a chip at the age of 37 behind DWades 2006 finals performance. Lets not pretend like he was much of a contributor...he didn't even average 3 PPG for the finals. Chris Paul has a much more polished offensive game and is probably the 3rd best defensive PG after Payton/Kidd so it's not like Payton's defense sets them that apart.
