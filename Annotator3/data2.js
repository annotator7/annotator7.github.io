I'd really like to know why you assume hand checking would make it that much harder since that was what was used when Jordan first came into the league, and the Bulls DID utilize a set that created a ton of space for Jordan; the league made it against the rules because the illegal defense rule allowed for it:\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1987/09/21/nba-creates-an-illegal-offense-call/7cbd3cb1-9f67-4a11-bb0d-bcc991b74982/?utm_term=.8566b26466fe\n\nThis was the point of me posting that link. Jordan DID thrive under these rules, but the fact that zone is legal today makes this a less likely possibility. Just because you run a 4/5 out does not mean that players will stick directly to their man. The **option** to run zone or some variant or even to shade over makes this a much harder task. \n\nNo, I do not believe it would be the lack of hand checking or foul calls that would allow Jordan to thrive because the former factor does not make it harder to score and the latter is not even true.\n\n\n"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7igo6v", "body": "[removed]"}, {"id": "dqyl0af", "body": "I don't mind the ringer.
