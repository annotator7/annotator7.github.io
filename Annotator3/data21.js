The 5th and 6th years are basically an internship on the hospitals here, where we work while being supervised by the medical teachers but we won't receive for the work. After graduation, everybody has general medical knowlegde, but usually applies for the residence tests of the hospitals (that actually works as a post graduation SAT). With good college grades and a good result on the hospital exam, it is possible to choose residence on the best hospitals here, like S\u00edrio Liban\u00eas or Hospital Albert Einstein.
