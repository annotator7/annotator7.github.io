It's fine though, I love it,\" said Oladipo. \"There's nothing better than proving people wrong.\" Oladipo took a step in the wrong direction last season, contributing just eighth-round value in standard 9-cat league behind averages of 15.9 points, 4.3 boards, 2.6 assists, 1.9 treys, 1.2 steals and 1.8 turnovers per game. **However, the drop in statistics had a lot more to do with how Russell Westbrook dominated the rock in OKC, and let's not forget that Dipo is just one-year removed from a top-35 season.** After a down-year, Oladipo could make for one of the better value picks as he looks to re-establish himself as an early-round guy.\n\n&gt;&gt;As expected, joining Oladipo in the starting five will be Darren Collison, Bojan Bogdanovic, Thaddeus Young and Myles Turner. Dipo was essentially relegated to being nothing more than a spot-up shooter in OKC last season, but he should go back to being a primary creator in Indiana's offense. He has a great shot of returning top-30 value on the season and will make for one of the better value picks towards the middle rounds on draft day.\n\nEven rotoworld shitting on Westbrook -- and this was before the season started  and the Thunder fell on their asses.\n"}, {"id": "dr2lhiz", "body": "Wish I read this shit before my draft."}, {"id": "dr2lhiz", "body": "Wish I read this shit before my draft."}, {"id": "dr2s2pp", "body": "lol.

Here is how I see it:\n\nRivers: First of all, he is a players' coach. He loves to commiserate with his players when they say \"coach, i swear i got fouled\", he says \"it's not your fault blake, you're a good player and you deserved that call!\" This is great for promoting a positive culture within the team. Doc is known for his consistent lineups, and he always lets the starters get their minutes. I would say one knock against him is that he doesn't seem to call the best plays towards the end of the 4th in close games. I think this weakness is easily outweighed by his purported ability to transmute lesser metals into gold, however.\n\nStotts: Terry was in the running for CoTY two years ago, and for good reason. He took a trailblasters squad that lacked a lot of front court talent and defensive instinct and turned them into a playoff team. Incredible! He loves to give minutes to the \"hot hand\", sometimes playing Vonleh for 30 mins a night, other times letting Ed Davis get lots of run.
