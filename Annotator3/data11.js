No Dre could hurt, their bench is quite good.\n\nSome thoughts on the game :\n\n* No Whiteside tonght but Bam is gonna cause us so much trouble, he's energetic and athletic, don't think Zaza will be able to defend him well. And a few moments into the game Bam is having a feast.\n\n* Draymond's ability to know where he and everybody else is on the court at all time is seriously impressing, he knew that Bam was waiting for him and dished it to an open Pachulia.\n\n* Not always been a fan of him, but Zaza lately is playing really well, for the past couple of weeks he's been more confident offensively, not missing easy lay-ups, and on defense, he's doing a good job shutting down big guys.\n\n* I hate when we play the Heat, they're playing us really well, slowing down the pace, no transition, and most of the time it's working. Everybody know Spoelstra is great, and I still think people underrate him.\n\n* Durant is struggling with his shot beyond the arc for the last two games, he was 0-3 against Orlando, and he starts 0-3 tonight. Curry is keepin us in the game with 16 points in the first.\n\n* 33-36 at the end of the first. Heat is playing well and our defense isn't keeping up. They're one of the team that play smartly physical with us, always at that limit of fouling, it always bothers the Dubs.\n\n* A lot of offball movement from both team, always finding the open man, only 1 turnover per team I believe, I like seeing the Warriors taking care of the ball tonight.\n\n* What is happening these days with refs and ejecting player on the first tech, it even looks like the ref is leaning on Livingston more, wtf is that ? Shaun is one of the last guys you think about when talking about ejection. Another guys with the first ejection of his career.\n\n* We should be attacking the rim every play Olynyk is on the floor, he can't do shit against Durant/Bell in this line-up. What a defense Bam just had on Curry, he gave him nothing, astounding.\n\n* 62-60 at half, better quarter from the Warriors, Heat keeps being physical with Steph, Dragic, is literally holding his shirt and nothing gets called. 20 points at the half for him.\n\n* 28 for Curry who came out of the locker room with a purpose, I think he doesn't want to play that 4th which would be great because the dubs have a back to back against NOLA, he's locked in.\n\n* We haven't seen the 3rd quarter \"magic\" for some time now. Dubs starts this one with a 16-2 run, the defense has picked up too, no easy bucket, active hands, everyone is putting some real effort, I think they're pissed.\n\n* Curry was trapped under the basket, the English on that shot was quite something, when he's hot, literally everything goes his way, a pleasure to watch. It's night and day for the Heat.\n\n* What I'm loving even more tonight is the fact we're taking care of the ball, no silly turnovers. Only 4 turnovers while our average is around 3 times that\n\n* They're taking shots way too quickly to end the 3rd, stay focused guys. Don't become lazy all of a sudden to allow for a Heat run. Bell is such a beast, that block on Dragic was filthy, and that alley-oop from Durant, they love playing with this guy, you can tell.\n\n* 99-77 at the end of the 3rd, 37 to 17, 3rd quarter Warriors strike again, Curry has 30, Durant had a really good quarter, ends up with 24, and 7 assists. Defense has been amazing. Let's hope to see some Kevon Looney in the 4th.\n\n* Warriors aren't complacent going into the 4th, defense shutting them down, no lazy rotations, everyone is still focused. We should see the bench opening in the next 2 minutes.\n\n* Who is it I see coming on the court, my man Looney. hope he can get something going in the few minutes he's getting. \n\n* 30+ assists for 4 turnovers tonight is great to see considering the amount of turnovers the Dubs are having this season. \n\nOverall, first half was tough, the Heat were playing great on both ends, then the 3rd quarter came, the Dubs turned on the jets, the Heat couldn't do much, we were suffocating them on D, they looked tired. GG Heat bros, see you next year\n\nTomorrow at NOLA will be a tough one, their shooting in the last two encounter was great. Will Davis be there ? Cousins might want to take his revenge on Zaza, he could be unstoppable, or really stoppable, I never know with this guy\n\nGood night everyone\n\n"}, {"id": "dqqaw8u", "body": "Second and last meeting of the Heat this year, watch out for Neon Dion guys ! No Dre could hurt, their bench is quite good.\n\nSome thoughts on the game :\n\n* No Whiteside tonght but Bam is gonna cause us so much trouble, he's energetic and athletic, don't think Zaza will be able to defend him well. And a few moments into the game Bam is having a feast.\n\n* Draymond's ability to know where he and everybody else is on the court at all time is seriously impressing, he knew that Bam was waiting for him and dished it to an open Pachulia.\n\n* Not always been a fan of him, but Zaza lately is playing really well, for the past couple of weeks he's been more confident offensively, not missing easy lay-ups, and on defense, he's doing a good job shutting down big guys.\n\n* I hate when we play the Heat, they're playing us really well, slowing down the pace, no transition, and most of the time it's working. Everybody know Spoelstra is great, and I still think people underrate him.\n\n* Durant is struggling with his shot beyond the arc for the last two games, he was 0-3 against Orlando, and he starts 0-3 tonight. Curry is keepin us in the game with 16 points in the first.\n\n* 33-36 at the end of the first. Heat is playing well and our defense isn't keeping up. They're one of the team that play smartly physical with us, always at that limit of fouling, it always bothers the Dubs.\n\n* A lot of offball movement from both team, always finding the open man, only 1 turnover per team I believe, I like seeing the Warriors taking care of the ball tonight.\n\n* What is happening these days with refs and ejecting player on the first tech, it even looks like the ref is leaning on Livingston more, wtf is that ? Shaun is one of the last guys you think about when talking about ejection. Another guys with the first ejection of his career.\n\n* We should be attacking the rim every play Olynyk is on the floor, he can't do shit against Durant/Bell in this line-up. What a defense Bam just had on Curry, he gave him nothing, astounding.\n\n* 62-60 at half, better quarter from the Warriors, Heat keeps being physical with Steph, Dragic, is literally holding his shirt and nothing gets called. 20 points at the half for him.\n\n* 28 for Curry who came out of the locker room with a purpose, I think he doesn't want to play that 4th which would be great because the dubs have a back to back against NOLA, he's locked in.\n\n* We haven't seen the 3rd quarter \"magic\" for some time now. Dubs starts this one with a 16-2 run, the defense has picked up too, no easy bucket, active hands, everyone is putting some real effort, I think they're pissed.\n\n* Curry was trapped under the basket, the English on that shot was quite something, when he's hot, literally everything goes his way, a pleasure to watch. It's night and day for the Heat.\n\n* What I'm loving even more tonight is the fact we're taking care of the ball, no silly turnovers. Only 4 turnovers while our average is around 3 times that\n\n* They're taking shots way too quickly to end the 3rd, stay focused guys. Don't become lazy all of a sudden to allow for a Heat run. Bell is such a beast, that block on Dragic was filthy, and that alley-oop from Durant, they love playing with this guy, you can tell.\n\n* 99-77 at the end of the 3rd, 37 to 17, 3rd quarter Warriors strike again, Curry has 30, Durant had a really good quarter, ends up with 24, and 7 assists. Defense has been amazing. Let's hope to see some Kevon Looney in the 4th.\n\n* Warriors aren't complacent going into the 4th, defense shutting them down, no lazy rotations, everyone is still focused. We should see the bench opening in the next 2 minutes.\n\n* Who is it I see coming on the court, my man Looney. hope he can get something going in the few minutes he's getting. \n\n* 30+ assists for 4 turnovers tonight is great to see considering the amount of turnovers the Dubs are having this season. \n\nOverall, first half was tough, the Heat were playing great on both ends, then the 3rd quarter came, the Dubs turned on the jets, the Heat couldn't do much, we were suffocating them on D, they looked tired. GG Heat bros, see you next year\n\nTomorrow at NOLA will be a tough one, their shooting in the last two encounter was great. Will Davis be there ? Cousins might want to take his revenge on Zaza, he could be unstoppable, or really stoppable, I never know with this guy\n\nGood night everyone\n\n"}, {"id": "dqqazf3", "body": "God damn it man.
