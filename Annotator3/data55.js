Cedi Osman with the hustle too, I like it. This cavs team is so fun to watch now that they're clicking lol. Can't wait for IT to come back \n"}, {"id": "dqlaqh8", "body": "Man.

Following the passing of legendary Flip Saunders, Mitchell was asked to step in and help the league\u2019s most exciting young team take the next step. Littered with potential in Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, the Wolves were expected to win meaningful games, and most NBA minds projected them to end their famous playoff drought. But after a year of lackluster play, in which the team\u2019s measly 29 wins was overshadowed only by the Head Coach\u2019s infuriating comments to the media, Wolves owner Glen Taylor decided that it was time to make a change; It was time to start treating the Timberwolves like a first-class NBA franchise. After all, you get what you pay for. Following a long interview process that featured some of the most sought after coaching candidates in the business, Taylor hired former Bulls Head Coach, and Celtics assistant, Tom Thibodeau. A coach whose name is synonymous with both outstanding X\u2019s and O\u2019s &amp; an all-time great winning percentage, as well as controversial coaching tactics, Thibs became the new face of Minnesota basketball. And after a year and a half at the helm, he is starting to show fans that he is a good man for the job.\n\n\n\nWhen the Timberwolves hired Thibodeau, one of the most common points of apprehension around the fan base was that he would be too focused on winning now, and that wouldn\u2019t be a good match for the team\u2019s young nucleus. As a Head Coach, Thibs had never missed the playoffs, and with such an inexperienced team, that was a very real possibility. Nonetheless, Thibs used year one exclusively for evaluation purposes. He didn\u2019t make a single splash in free agency, instead deciding to hold onto the Timberwolves cap space during an offseason in which more than a handful of teams doled out unthinkable contracts. Thibs signed three middling free agents to relatively cheap and short contracts, but reserved the lion\u2019s share of minutes for the young core. Despite the fact that inexperience prevailed, and the Wolves only won 31 games, Thibs knew exactly what he had to work with. Entering year two, the President of Basketball Operations went on to produce the Wolves most effective offseason in team history. First he traded injured Zach LaVine and 23 year old rookie Kris Dunn for superstar Jimmy Butler in a deal that included a first round pick swap. He proceeded to sign former all-star Jeff Teague, and a reliable, defensive minded veteran in Taj Gibson. Ahead of Kevin Martin, those are the two most accomplished free agent signings the Wolves have ever enjoyed. And don\u2019t forget former sixth man of the year Jamal Crawford. Despite working through the bumps and bruises of incorporating three new starters, the Wolves have had their best start to a season in over a decade: they sit at 4th in the Western Conference with a 21-13 record, which includes an 18-6 mark against the west, and 7 wins alongside just 1 loss in a rugged Northwest division. Simply put, Thibs has not displayed the impatience that some feared, and the team is succeeding. From saving sacred cap space for an offseason when it could be used more efficiently to refusing to pull the trigger on a deal that would have sent out the team\u2019s only 2018 first round pick for bench wing CJ Miles, Thibs has followed the long-term track that most everyone hoped for, but the vast majority didn\u2019t expect. \n\n\n\nThe impressive series of moves that Thibodeau made this offseason highlights an even more important point: Glen Taylor chose to pay Thibs $8 million/year because he wanted to take winning seriously, and that\u2019s exactly what a man with the pedigree of Thibs is able to do. His first big move, which came a year after he was hired, produced a legitimate top 10 NBA player \u2013 the most exciting one the fan base has seen since Kevin Garnett was traded to Thibodeau\u2019s Celtics. This is the kind of deal that the Wolves have had the young talent to make in years past, but have avoided out of fear. Fear that that youth traded away would exceed expectations, fear that the incoming player wouldn\u2019t work out with the Wolves, and most importantly, fear that the player would leave the frozen tundra the first chance they got. This has proven to be an ineffective mindset \u2013 and Thibodeau has changed it. The reason that the Wolves were able to go get a guy like Jimmy Butler, with any hope of him staying beyond his current contract, is Tom Thibodeau. The reason that Kyrie Irving listed the Timberwolves amongst the four teams (Heat, Spurs, Knicks) he would prefer to be traded to in the offseason, is because Thibodeau went out and got Jimmy Butler, and because of Thibodeau\u2019s relationship with USA basketball stars. That was the first time that Wolves fans and players saw their team as a destination, and that is incredibly meaningful. In just one and a half seasons, Thibs transformed the Timberwolves from a laughingstock among all professional sports to a hopeful landing spot for an NBA Champion. \n\n\n\nTom Thibodeau is a controversial Head Coach, and he certainly doesn\u2019t come without faults. The minutes conundrum can be overblown, as /u/Morezingis [pointed out in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l41u3/oc_the_tom_thibodeau_minutes_dilemma_and/), but I would still like to see Thibs tone down Butler and Towns\u2019 playing time to keep them fresh for the playoffs, and healthy for years to come. I would like to see more creative lineups utilized, like a Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones backcourt, or more Jimmy Butler as a power forward (Thibs has used this lineup some, and it has admittedly been ineffective). Thibs needs to work on executing more successful after timeout plays, too, especially near the end of games. It was also highlighted over and over again by the TNT crew on Christmas day that the offense often doesn\u2019t attempt a field goal until the end of the shot clock, and could be more successful if focused on getting out in transition (an argument that I disagree with to an extent, because the Wolves struggle mightily on defense when pace picks up). But none of these mostly minor gripes should overshadow the fact that Thibs has renovated a worn down franchise. He\u2019s brought winning basketball back to Minnesota, giving all of us impassioned fans a reason to check the standings, to watch competitors games, and to come root for our guys.

Following the passing of legendary Flip Saunders, Mitchell was asked to step in and help the league\u2019s most exciting young team take the next step. Littered with potential in Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, the Wolves were expected to win meaningful games, and most NBA minds projected them to end their famous playoff drought. But after a year of lackluster play, in which the team\u2019s measly 29 wins was overshadowed only by the Head Coach\u2019s infuriating comments to the media, Wolves owner Glen Taylor decided that it was time to make a change; It was time to start treating the Timberwolves like a first-class NBA franchise. After all, you get what you pay for. Following a long interview process that featured some of the most sought after coaching candidates in the business, Taylor hired former Bulls Head Coach, and Celtics assistant, Tom Thibodeau. A coach whose name is synonymous with both outstanding X\u2019s and O\u2019s &amp; an all-time great winning percentage, as well as controversial coaching tactics, Thibs became the new face of Minnesota basketball. And after a year and a half at the helm, he is starting to show fans that he is a good man for the job.\n\n\n\nWhen the Timberwolves hired Thibodeau, one of the most common points of apprehension around the fan base was that he would be too focused on winning now, and that wouldn\u2019t be a good match for the team\u2019s young nucleus. As a Head Coach, Thibs had never missed the playoffs, and with such an inexperienced team, that was a very real possibility. Nonetheless, Thibs used year one exclusively for evaluation purposes. He didn\u2019t make a single splash in free agency, instead deciding to hold onto the Timberwolves cap space during an offseason in which more than a handful of teams doled out unthinkable contracts. Thibs signed three middling free agents to relatively cheap and short contracts, but reserved the lion\u2019s share of minutes for the young core. Despite the fact that inexperience prevailed, and the Wolves only won 31 games, Thibs knew exactly what he had to work with. Entering year two, the President of Basketball Operations went on to produce the Wolves most effective offseason in team history. First he traded injured Zach LaVine and 23 year old rookie Kris Dunn for superstar Jimmy Butler in a deal that included a first round pick swap. He proceeded to sign former all-star Jeff Teague, and a reliable, defensive minded veteran in Taj Gibson. Ahead of Kevin Martin, those are the two most accomplished free agent signings the Wolves have ever enjoyed. And don\u2019t forget former sixth man of the year Jamal Crawford. Despite working through the bumps and bruises of incorporating three new starters, the Wolves have had their best start to a season in over a decade: they sit at 4th in the Western Conference with a 21-13 record, which includes an 18-6 mark against the west, and 7 wins alongside just 1 loss in a rugged Northwest division. Simply put, Thibs has not displayed the impatience that some feared, and the team is succeeding. From saving sacred cap space for an offseason when it could be used more efficiently to refusing to pull the trigger on a deal that would have sent out the team\u2019s only 2018 first round pick for bench wing CJ Miles, Thibs has followed the long-term track that most everyone hoped for, but the vast majority didn\u2019t expect. \n\n\n\nThe impressive series of moves that Thibodeau made this offseason highlights an even more important point: Glen Taylor chose to pay Thibs $8 million/year because he wanted to take winning seriously, and that\u2019s exactly what a man with the pedigree of Thibs is able to do. His first big move, which came a year after he was hired, produced a legitimate top 10 NBA player \u2013 the most exciting one the fan base has seen since Kevin Garnett was traded to Thibodeau\u2019s Celtics. This is the kind of deal that the Wolves have had the young talent to make in years past, but have avoided out of fear. Fear that that youth traded away would exceed expectations, fear that the incoming player wouldn\u2019t work out with the Wolves, and most importantly, fear that the player would leave the frozen tundra the first chance they got. This has proven to be an ineffective mindset \u2013 and Thibodeau has changed it. The reason that the Wolves were able to go get a guy like Jimmy Butler, with any hope of him staying beyond his current contract, is Tom Thibodeau. The reason that Kyrie Irving listed the Timberwolves amongst the four teams (Heat, Spurs, Knicks) he would prefer to be traded to in the offseason, is because Thibodeau went out and got Jimmy Butler, and because of Thibodeau\u2019s relationship with USA basketball stars. That was the first time that Wolves fans and players saw their team as a destination, and that is incredibly meaningful. In just one and a half seasons, Thibs transformed the Timberwolves from a laughingstock among all professional sports to a hopeful landing spot for an NBA Champion. \n\n\n\nTom Thibodeau is a controversial Head Coach, and he certainly doesn\u2019t come without faults. The minutes conundrum can be overblown, as /u/Morezingis [pointed out in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7l41u3/oc_the_tom_thibodeau_minutes_dilemma_and/), but I would still like to see Thibs tone down Butler and Towns\u2019 playing time to keep them fresh for the playoffs, and healthy for years to come. I would like to see more creative lineups utilized, like a Jeff Teague and Tyus Jones backcourt, or more Jimmy Butler as a power forward (Thibs has used this lineup some, and it has admittedly been ineffective). Thibs needs to work on executing more successful after timeout plays, too, especially near the end of games. It was also highlighted over and over again by the TNT crew on Christmas day that the offense often doesn\u2019t attempt a field goal until the end of the shot clock, and could be more successful if focused on getting out in transition (an argument that I disagree with to an extent, because the Wolves struggle mightily on defense when pace picks up).
