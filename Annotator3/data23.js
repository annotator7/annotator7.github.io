While many on this subreddit like to pin all the blame on Durant for game 6 and the series as a whole (despite Westbrook playing poorly down the stretch as well), Durant came to play in game 7.

Not so much. \n\n&gt;He was already on a team well equipped to not just compete but over throw the Warriors, and granted he may have not trusted the FO - who knows. But it's like Jordan joining the pistons, LeBron joining the Celtics.\n\nThe problem with this is that OKC traded Ibaka away that summer. Ibaka was a huge cornerstone to the defensive schemes that gave Golden State so much trouble in that series. As a result, it isn't too hard to imagine Durant being upset that everytime the team seemed to be ready to take over the NBA, the front office threw a wrench into their plans. Because a similar situation happened six years ago when they dealt away Harden the summer following OKC's finals appearance.\n\n&gt;His situation is different than LeBron joining the heat because the heat weren't proven contenders\n\nNo they weren't, but that is because Riley was in on the trio's plans to get together on one team in free agency. All one has to do is look at how almost every contract they signed with players ended in the summer of 2010. One also has to consider how, despite being at the top of the East, LeBron left Miami to form a second, even better team of multiple all-stars in Cleveland with an absurd team salary.\n\n&gt; and the team LeBron was leaving was clearly not a playoff tram without him.\n\nPlease remember that the team Durant left needed Westbrook taking on an absurd offensive burden to get the sixth seed, and that was after a mid-season trade. Their point differential was less than 1. \n\nUltimately, it is a bit hypocritical for many on this subreddit to blast Durant but make excuse after excuse for LeBron despite both of them doing essentially the same thing- ring chasing."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7hjmg8", "body": ""}, {"id": "dqrgiwx", "body": "he gone"}, {"id": "dqrgiwx", "body": "he gone"}, {"id": "dqrj8pt", "body": "Se queda."}, {"id": "dqrj8pt", "body": "Se queda."}, {"id": "dqrmo50", "body": "\u5f7c\u306f\u884c\u3063\u305f"}, {"id": "dqrmo50", "body": "\u5f7c\u306f\u884c\u3063\u305f"}, {"id": "dqro454", "body": " \u306a\u306b"}, {"id": "dqro454", "body": " \u306a\u306b"}, {"id": "dqrysai", "body": "\u5f7c\u306f\u884c\u3063\u305f"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7hjmg8", "body": ""}, {"id": "dqrgjrc", "body": "Already booked the trip to cleveland"}, {"id": "dqrgjrc", "body": "Already booked the trip to cleveland"}, {"id": "dqrnpc2", "body": "I'm sure it's just for vacation.
