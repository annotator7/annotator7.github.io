Its an attempt to dismiss the argument without responding to it. \n\nIt's akin to the down vote oblivion you'd find yourself in if you criticized WB last season. You were dismissed. Censored.

Considering LeBron has played far more minutes than either MJ or Kobe did at the same age, it isn\u2019t much of a knock on him that he doesn\u2019t go all out defensively for 48 minutes per game as neither did these greats.\n\n- That the 2012 Thunder had to trade James Harden and that it didn\u2019t matter in the long run as Harden wouldn\u2019t have developed into an elite player behind Westbrook and KD. As many have noted, the Harden trade amounted to shortsightedness by the Thunder and a stubbornness of the ownership to not pay the luxury tax, despite the fact that OKC had just made the finals with a nucleus everyone was hailing as the indisputable future of the NBA. However some argue that the trade isn\u2019t as bad as it seems in hindsight as Harden would\u2019ve never had become an MVP level talent. Coming off of one of the most efficient sixth man of the year seasons of all time, Harden was already an elite player having been the driving force that led the Thunder over the resurgent Spurs. He was also selected to the 2012 olympic team at just 22 years old and was already regarded as a steady hand OKC needed when Westbrook was having inefficient moments. That OKC team most certainly would\u2019ve been the dynasty of the 2010s, as oppose to the warriors, based on the level of talent they possessed and James Harden would\u2019ve continued developing to being one of the best in the league as he was already approaching this status."}, {"id": "drwsaq7", "body": "i watch every c's game and Smart really doesnt flop anymore, or at least has gotten rid of the \"flops every other game\" reputation to me. and yes, that includes last night"}, {"id": "drwsaq7", "body": "i watch every c's game and Smart really doesnt flop anymore, or at least has gotten rid of the \"flops every other game\" reputation to me. and yes, that includes last night"}, {"id": "drwsdpf", "body": "I think last night made most of r/nba fall in love with Smart tbh (including me)."}, {"id": "drwsdpf", "body": "I think last night made most of r/nba fall in love with Smart tbh (including me)."}, {"id": "drwsho1", "body": "its funny cuz im actually a very anti-marcus smart celtics fan, because i believe for every 2 winning plays he makes for us, i think he makes 3 losing plays (boneheaded foul or turnover, horrible pass, terrible shot, etc). but i really have to eat crow after games like that"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7lu1b2", "body": " Which player could you see being much better if they were just given more touches or if they were in a better system?"}, {"id": "drozlql", "body": "Bennett"}, {"id": "drozlql", "body": "Bennett"}, {"id": "drozmbh", "body": "oh God"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7lu1b2", "body": " Which player could you see being much better if they were just given more touches or if they were in a better system?"}, {"id": "drozme7", "body": "Mario Hezonja has shown in recent games that he really isn't that bad, he's no world-beater but in the right system his shooting and size is a deadly combination."}, {"id": "drozme7", "body": "Mario Hezonja has shown in recent games that he really isn't that bad, he's no world-beater but in the right system his shooting and size is a deadly combination."}, {"id": "drozvdv", "body": "Please, he's had ample opportunity to shine.
