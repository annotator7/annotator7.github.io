One of the worst things in basketball is when another ref comes over from across the court to overturn a call made by a ref right in front of the play. Like they saw what happened through the player's back from 50 feet away. And then there's crap like [this](https://youtu.be/9jvP2YPQT_E?t=35). Player in white, Napier for UConn, flops as if the player in Blue for Kentucky hit him. The ref, standing directly in front of him, called it a foul against Kentucky. It was a momentum changer for the game. The ref in question is Higgins, who is so bad and has made so many blatantly bad calls against Kentucky that when he called a horrible first half for Kentucky in the UK/UNC game last year (bad enough the announcers were shocked), fans flooded his business page on FB with hate and called the number to attack him. He got the FBI involved, and the NCAA not only put him in the Final Four but they also gave him an award as one of the best refs this year.  \n\n&gt; As a soccer fan, the whole concept of we reff differently in regular season games, vs playoffs vs last 2 min of the game is absolutely insane to me. \n\nAs a soccer fan, you should be familiar with a myriad of ridiculous officiating issues and poor sportsmanship issues (like diving and refs giving a card when they didn't actually see the foul but instead see a guy on the ground). But specifically to the point, how often do you see a ref give a yellow for a delay of game/wasting time in the first 80 minutes of a match compared to the end? And whether something is a penalty or just coincidental contact definitely never becomes a bigger issue in the World Cup versus in a Friendly, of course... That's just right off the top of my head. Refs call games different depending on the importance, the players involved, the score, the location, etc. in every sport. \n\nRefs shouldn't call any differently based on the player, in theory, but you know they do. And as with any sport, if a player has a history of a behavior, refs should and often are watching out for it. But then it becomes a self-fulfilling thing, too, where players are unfairly penalized because refs assume them guilty. Happens in soccer as much as any sport."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7m4193", "body": ""}, {"id": "drr9x7v", "body": "CLEAN BLOCK.\n\nSHOW THE CONTACT."}, {"id": "drr9x7v", "body": "CLEAN BLOCK.\n\nSHOW THE CONTACT."}, {"id": "drrhnma", "body": "They did show the contact.
