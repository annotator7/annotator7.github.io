The fact he led the league probably means for most coaches he\u2019d probably play somewhat to take the load off kat, he\u2019s not that bad and it\u2019s not like the wolves were so competitive all those games. He was also making 4 million a year. cole aldrich got some more minutes, but he's still a solid player getting 7 million per year that wasn't getting minutes. You don\u2019t have to play your good player all the minutes and you\u2019re less good player none of them, especially when you\u2019re only winning 31 games. \n\nthis post from last year too: [tom thibodeau is a maniac.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/65773z/tom_thibodeau_is_a_maniac/)\n\nand of course, the rose and lavine injuries--the rose one coming in the last minutes of a decided game. while more minutes doesn't necessarily lead to more acl tears and what not, obviously with less minutes you're less likely to get hurt. and i'm sure it does have somewhat of an impact. edit: it does. from /u/pm_me_ur_insecurites: \n\nhttp://www.sloansportsconference.com/content/preventing-in-game-injuries-for-nba-players/\n\n\n&gt;Finally, the model shows the style of play is a huge indicator on injuries. The average speed someone runs, the average minutes played and average distance travelled by a player during all games are big indicators of injuries. This is a key factor that should be taken into account to prevent injuries. A coach can start to manage minutes played by the NBA player from the start of the season in a more effective way.\n\n\nThey identify which players are at highest risk for injury and found that:\n\n\n&gt;For example, if we rested the top 20% of high risk players it would potentially prevent 60% of all injuries (marked in Figure 3).

It increases wear and tear.  But it always wins games, and you can get injured in the first minute of play. Ask Yinke Dare or Gordon Hayward.\n\nAnd keep in mind, Wilt played monster minute until the age of 36.  Kareem played marathons throughout the 70's and still managed to play to the age of 41. K. Malone did the same, playing an averaged of over 36 minutes a game for 16 years and he was still posting 36 a game at 39 years of age.  Kareem played over 40 minutes a game for the first 7 years and averaged over 40 minutes over his first 12 years and still played starting minutes until the age of 41. \n\nWith proper conditioning, a player can handle this.  The risk of injury is always there, and on a long enough time line that chance increases, and more minutes increases it. Yes. But if you take care of yourself, and you have a good team of trainers, there's no reason a guy can't play 36+ on back-to-back nights and 3 out of 4 nights.\n\n\nThat said... I don't agree with that approach.  I like Pop's approach.  It gets the rest of the team involved and gives guys on the bench a chance to develop. But... if you aren't deep, you can't do that without sacrificing games.  If you are in re-build mode, knock yourself out: you have nothing to lose.

There's an exercise bike there, and Atkinson is on it, pedaling furiously.  \n**It's 4:30 in the morning.**  \n\nA few hours earlier, the Nets lost another game, and this is the punishing ritual of the coach of the worst team in the NBA. After paltry few hours of sleep, he watches the loss again, on a laptop mounted to his bike. When the Nets screw something up, he turns up the resistance knob on the bike.  \n\nFast. Faster.  \n\nHe types madly on the keyboard as ideas come, his hands already damp with perspiration. The worse the team plays, the harder he pedals. The harder he pedals, the more he sweats on the laptop. \"If you sweat on them too much, the whole thing blows up,\" Atkinson explains in his distinctive Long Island drawl. He's a first-year coach on his fourth laptop.  \n...  \nBy the time Atkinson falls into bed, it is after 1 o'clock in the morning.  \n\nThree and a half hours later, his alarm rattles him awake.  \n\nTime to get back on the bike.  \""}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7n32g8", "body": "Of course some fanbases have made it clear what they think of their coach (Bucks, Wolves etc), but for others I'm not quite sure what the general sentiment of the fanbase it.
