It\u2019s obviously a marketing gimmick to get jersey sales in China because Yao Ming and Zhou Qi, but this is supposed to be about the city. They couldn\u2019t design something to do with NASA since we have fucking mission control here. Or something about our rodeo, which is the largest in the world. Or something Vietnamese since we have one of if not the largest population of Vietnamese immigrants in the US. Or something with bayous since we\u2019re known as the Bayou City. Or something oil/energy related because that is one of the city\u2019s primary industries. I mean look at Utah\u2019s jersey. They have an awesome design inspired by their geography. Golden State has a cool design based on one of the most famous places I\u2019d say in the US, their Chinatown. San Antonio has camo because of all its AFBs. And here comes Houston with fucking Chinese characters. They really had a chance to capture the essence of the city as a whole, and instead they went for a cheap and lazy marketing gimmick.\n\n/rant\n\nedit: I can\u2019t believe I forgot Jeremy Lin as part of our Chinese/Taiwanese heritage"}, {"id": "drtqvp8", "body": "TIL Houston is known as the \"Bayou City\" "}, {"id": "drtqvp8", "body": "TIL Houston is known as the \"Bayou City\" "}, {"id": "drtsvv1", "body": "We have a ton of bayous and waterways including the Houston ship channel which is an extremely critical shipping point"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7mfxw5", "body": ""}, {"id": "drtptyx", "body": "I want to wear the Blazers jersey as a fan but I don't know if they'll look good on the players..."}, {"id": "drtptyx", "body": "I want to wear the Blazers jersey as a fan but I don't know if they'll look good on the players..."}, {"id": "drtx6u0", "body": "Let's be honest, everything looks good on Dame."}, {"id": "drtx6u0", "body": "Let's be honest, everything looks good on Dame."}, {"id": "drtyean", "body": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRx1o6BVAAAcMcN.jpg:large"}, {"id": "drtyean", "body": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DRx1o6BVAAAcMcN.jpg:large"}, {"id": "dru13kl", "body": "I'll be real, I think he pulls it off.
