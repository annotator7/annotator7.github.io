He got Stevens so frustrated that by Play 8, you can hear him yell \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" I describe and include links to those plays below, as well as a few plays that weren't A/B plays, but just required a crazy amount of work just to get a single good look.\n\nA - [Play 1:](https://streamable.com/nexkh) **Ellington comes off the down-screen** by Mickey, takes the pass, and drives to the hoop. This sets up...\n\nB - [Play 2:](https://streamable.com/jii53) **Ellington gets ready to come off the down-screen** by Olynyk but notices that Smart is playing him too hard, so when he feels Smart on his back, he cuts back along the baseline for an open lane to the rim.\n\nA - [Play 3:](https://streamable.com/f7gqp) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint. Ellington takes the hand-off, squares up, and shoots.\n\nB - [Play 10:](https://streamable.com/n7m97) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words.

He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball.

He got Stevens so frustrated that by Play 8, you can hear him yell \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" I describe and include links to those plays below, as well as a few plays that weren't A/B plays, but just required a crazy amount of work just to get a single good look.\n\nA - [Play 1:](https://streamable.com/nexkh) **Ellington comes off the down-screen** by Mickey, takes the pass, and drives to the hoop. This sets up...\n\nB - [Play 2:](https://streamable.com/jii53) **Ellington gets ready to come off the down-screen** by Olynyk but notices that Smart is playing him too hard, so when he feels Smart on his back, he cuts back along the baseline for an open lane to the rim.\n\nA - [Play 3:](https://streamable.com/f7gqp) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint. Ellington takes the hand-off, squares up, and shoots.\n\nB - [Play 10:](https://streamable.com/n7m97) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words.

He got Stevens so frustrated that by Play 8, you can hear him yell \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" I describe and include links to those plays below, as well as a few plays that weren't A/B plays, but just required a crazy amount of work just to get a single good look.\n\nA - [Play 1:](https://streamable.com/nexkh) **Ellington comes off the down-screen** by Mickey, takes the pass, and drives to the hoop. This sets up...\n\nB - [Play 2:](https://streamable.com/jii53) **Ellington gets ready to come off the down-screen** by Olynyk but notices that Smart is playing him too hard, so when he feels Smart on his back, he cuts back along the baseline for an open lane to the rim.\n\nA - [Play 3:](https://streamable.com/f7gqp) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint. Ellington takes the hand-off, squares up, and shoots.\n\nB - [Play 10:](https://streamable.com/n7m97) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words. "}, {"id": "drnaidf", "body": "Can anyone tell me what it feels like to have a good coach?

Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down.

Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters.

Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint.

Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words.

This sets up...\n\nB - [Play 2:](https://streamable.com/jii53) **Ellington gets ready to come off the down-screen** by Olynyk but notices that Smart is playing him too hard, so when he feels Smart on his back, he cuts back along the baseline for an open lane to the rim.\n\nA - [Play 3:](https://streamable.com/f7gqp) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint. Ellington takes the hand-off, squares up, and shoots.\n\nB - [Play 10:](https://streamable.com/n7m97) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words.

He ran several A/B plays in a row in the 4th that the Celtics absolutely could not figure out how to defend, when to help, when to switch, or when to stay home. He made them make a ton of decisions, betting that eventually they would make a mistake, and his players took advantage of each one. He got Stevens so frustrated that by Play 8, you can hear him yell \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" I describe and include links to those plays below, as well as a few plays that weren't A/B plays, but just required a crazy amount of work just to get a single good look.\n\nA - [Play 1:](https://streamable.com/nexkh) **Ellington comes off the down-screen** by Mickey, takes the pass, and drives to the hoop. This sets up...\n\nB - [Play 2:](https://streamable.com/jii53) **Ellington gets ready to come off the down-screen** by Olynyk but notices that Smart is playing him too hard, so when he feels Smart on his back, he cuts back along the baseline for an open lane to the rim.\n\nA - [Play 3:](https://streamable.com/f7gqp) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** Horford cuts off the passing lane in the paint, which Olynyk sees. Olynyk flairs to the wing, gets the pass, and hits the wide open 3. This play works because Kyrie won't leave Johnson to contest the shot. \n\nB - [Play 4:](https://streamable.com/erwej) **Ellington runs up and around a double-screen by Johnson and Olynyk. He has Tatum totally beat as he rolls off the screens and cuts toward the rim.** This time Horford stays home. Ellington once again has Tatum totally beat, but the pass doesn't meet Ellington under the rim, so Ellington keeps running, comes up to the 3-point line, catches, turns, and shoots. Tatum still hasn't caught up. \n\n[Play 5:](https://streamable.com/zpddu) This was an awesome play. Mickey sets a down-screen for Ellington. Richardson passes to Ellington as Brown trails. Ellington passes right back to Richardson and keeps running and takes Tatum with him. Brown stops running and picks up Richardson. Richardson throws it to Mickey on the wing and fakes Brown out of his shoes. Mickey passes back to Richardson, who's wide open at the top of the key. Smart helps in the paint, which Olynyk sees, so he crashes to the paint. Tatum sees this and picks Olynyk up. At the same time, Brown recovers to Richardson and Smart recovers back to the 3-point line to try to locate Olynyk, who's no longer there. Smart chases Olynyk into the paint, but Tatum points for Smart to pick up either Ellington or Waiters in the corner. Richardson still has the ball and Mickey sets another pick for him. While this is happening, Smart is recovering to the wing where Waiters is, but Kyrie is still guarding Waiters. Smart tells Kyrie to go the corner, but Kyrie doesn't hear him, forcing Smart to guard Ellington in the corner. Now when Richardson delivers the ball to Mickey, Kyrie is on the wing instead of Smart, and Kyrie doesn't help. Tatum challenges at the rim but Mickey double pumps and scores.\n\nA - [Play 6:](https://streamable.com/n1ifg) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington runs to Mickey, who hands-off to Ellington while using his body to further slow Brown down. Theis goes to the paint to prevent the drive, so Ellington squares up and hits the 3. \n\nB - [Play 7:](https://streamable.com/jmn4p) **Waiters passes to Mickey and sets a pick on Brown.** Ellington curls inside this time, and he takes Kyrie with him. Brown doesn't recognize the switch and is late recovering to Waiters. Mickey passes back to Waiters who recognizes that Brown is late and drives in and misses. \n\n[Pick 8: \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\"](https://streamable.com/qmf8m) Tatum's on Richardson and Brown's on Ellington. Ellington comes off the double down-screens by Mickey and Olynyk. Smart shows, right as Ellington catches the pass. Smart sees that Ellington has the ball, so he switches on to Ellington just as Ellington throws it back to Richardson. Brown sees the switch and turns around to locate Olynyk right as Richardson catches the ball. Richardson sees that Brown looks lost and throws it to Olynyk, who fakes Brown out, but passes back to Richardson instead of driving. Olynyk then fakes a screen for Richardson and slips the screen, using his butt to back Brown up. Tatum expects the screen and sags off Richardson, who dribbles to the wing, and then inside. Tatum plays on Richardson's hip, which would allow Brown to trap, but Brown stays home, and they totally lose Richardson as he drives to the lane. Stevens yells \"NO FUCKING SWITCHING!\" and is furious.\n\nA - [Play 9:](https://streamable.com/o6d1j) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington curls off Olynyk's body, Rozier trailing.** Olynyk hands off as Smart collapses to the paint. Ellington takes the hand-off, squares up, and shoots.\n\nB - [Play 10:](https://streamable.com/n7m97) **Smart is guarding Olynyk who has the ball. Ellington picks for Olynyk.** This time Olynyk puts the ball on the floor and forces Rozier to switch onto him, posts him up, and scores.\n\n[Play 11:](https://streamable.com/t0k60) This was a really fun play. Olynyk picks Kyrie, so Smart shows. Ellington looks like he's running over to set a pick on Smart, so Smart points for Rozier to pick up Olynyk as he rolls. Ellington slips the screen, so Rozier goes with him, right as Waiters passes to a rolling Olynyk who has an open lane to the rim. Olynyk throws down a monster slam.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the kind words.

A response to another comment on here.\n\nThat being said, I think Brad Stevens clearly didn't make sure his team understood the concept of not switching. There have been way too many instances of Celtics switching off an utter mismatch, (such as Kyrie switching off to a the roll player in case 11)\n\nI also think we need to understand the switch concept isn't really the foundation that makes this team such great defense; I think it's their willingness to contest three's. I understand the weak correlation for contested three's and percentage. But celtics' has been incredible at coming over to contest the deep balls; however, as I mentioned, these threes will fall at some point, and Celtics' defense will fall drastically. \n\nI'm not sure Celtics can sustain this level of defense in the playoffs, where great teams benefit off mismatches. Especially considering cavs and wizards have all the option to do so.

I had my first apartment in college and even though my parents were paying for the rent, I learned that I have to give the check to my landlord on time every month. I learned how to wake up myself and be where I need to be without my mom's help. I learned that I have to have a maid if I'm going to keep being single because that's just how I am. I learned how to tell white lies to my professors to get extensions the same way I tell my customers now. And again, NBA life is different than what most of us do and these kids have been learning about that life from their AAU coaches at a young age more than anyone else. I mean anyone can learn the things I learned in college while having a job, but you don't have that margin of error when you're a professional. \n\nI don't want to be misunderstood though. I personally loved college and appreciated every minute of it. Not just the fun I had but the things they taught me in the classrooms and outside. But at the end of the day, my dad prepared me a lot better than any of my teachers or professors could for the professional life that was waiting me. College taught me how to act, how to find what I'm looking for and things like that and I employ them in my field of work. It's different for NBA. My best friend for example dropped out of college I think in his senior year because the better opportunity was there for him. He was in film school and his summer internship all of a sudden turned into a full-time producer job for a FX series. Similar to choosing NBA over NCAA if you're good enough, he did the right thing by dropping out of college. He's had a successful career so far, and it's been years since the series got cancelled but he's been working on tons of other projects extremely successfully. Whenever I tell him to take care of college just to get the diploma at least, he always tells me he'll probably do it eventually, but at the end of the day it's just for a piece of paper. Clearly he's done pretty well without it. Just because it works for so many people doesn't mean that everyone needs it."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7iezbm", "body": "[removed]"}, {"id": "dqy7hvh", "body": "I think the problem people have is with Lavar he is making money off his kids and now he's robbing them of the college experience.

I'd gladly get my free education from a top flight school, compete for championships, and hoop with my boys. And then when it's all said and done he can go work for BBB and make bank or if that doesn't work out he's got one of the most respected degrees in the nation. \n\nI can understand LaMelo doing this because professional basketball is by far his number 1 goal though.

Baker signing a 9 million dollar contract (which isn't much today but still a contract) is not looking good one bit, as he is out of the rotation, despite playing decent minutes last game vs. the Pacers because of having KP and Tim out. And Sessions is just not good, both offense and defense, it happens. I was more expecting Ron to step up and be valuable for the Knicks, having signed a contract, but he's been disappointing.
