Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Gilbert, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Gilbert put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt.
