All Thunder players who weren't drafted by the Thunder are returned to their previous team.\n\nThe Thunder's new starting lineup is probably:\n\nPG - Russell Westbrook\n\nSG - James Harden\n\nSF - Kevin Durant\n\nPF - Serge Ibaka\n\nC - Steven Adams\n\nBench:\nEric Bledsoe\nQuincy Poindexter \nAlex Abrines\nJosh Huestis\nCarl Landry\n\nObviously the backcourt is stacked, but this team lacks a bit of frontcourt depth. Can they get out of the Western Conference, defeating the Durant-less Warriors and Harden-less Rockets? And in the NBA finals, can the Thunder take down Lebron and Co.?\n"}, {"id": "drqdrtq", "body": "KD wasn't drafted by the Thunder"}, {"id": "drqdrtq", "body": "KD wasn't drafted by the Thunder"}, {"id": "drqtaoa", "body": "Nor was Westbrook"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "Thread_ends", "body": "Thread_ends"}, {"id": "7lm00e", "body": ""}, {"id": "drn8ckq", "body": "oof"}, {"id": "drn8ckq", "body": "oof"}, {"id": "drnbknl", "body": "owie"}, {"id": "drnbknl", "body": "owie"}, {"id": "drnc5wk", "body": "Ouchie"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7lm00e", "body": ""}, {"id": "drn8cqh", "body": "i bet he eats ass for breakfast "}, {"id": "drn8cqh", "body": "i bet he eats ass for breakfast "}, {"id": "drn9xjp", "body": "HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH oh man, its still funny  the 8227363889228th time!"}, {"id": "drn9xjp", "body": "HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH oh man, its still funny  the 8227363889228th time!"}, {"id": "drna5yl", "body": "Oh I totally bet you didn't find that funny, u/dickcocknutfuck ;)"}, {"id": "drna5yl", "body": "Oh I totally bet you didn't find that funny, u/dickcocknutfuck ;)"}, {"id": "drna7bm", "body": "At least its not rehashing the same 6month old joke in every single fucking thread"}, {"id": "drna7bm", "body": "At least its not rehashing the same 6month old joke in every single fucking thread"}, {"id": "drnaiiv", "body": "Be the change you want to see in the world."}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7lm00e", "body": ""}, {"id": "drn8d06", "body": "SHOTS FIRED \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b"}, {"id": "drn8d06", "body": "SHOTS FIRED \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b"}, {"id": "drn90sb", "body": "ROCKETS FIRED.
