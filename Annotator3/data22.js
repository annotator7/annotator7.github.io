Many media outlets and players also seem to feel the same, with quite a bit of backlash on the Grizzlies for the decision to fire him. \n\nWhat I want to know is why people think he's a great coach? In the 2015-2016 season the Memphis Grizzlies secured the 7th seed with a 42-40 record, without Fizdale. In the 2016-2017 season, the Memphis Grizzlies secured the 7th seed with a 43-40 record, pretty much no improvement.\n\nBoth teams were eliminated in the 1st round by the Spurs. Admittedly, they went 2-4 2016 rather than getting getting swept 0-4 in 2015. But that can be due to a multitude of reasons, either way there was no real shot of them winning the series. \n\nIn the 2015-2016 season, coach Joereger had LESS games of Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. \n\nMike Conley 2015-2016 GP: 56 \nMarc Gasol 2015-2016 GP: 52\n\nMike Conley 2015-2016 GP: 69 \nMarc Gasol 2016-2017 GP: 74\n\nThat's a pretty significant amount of extra games played by the two stars of the team. \n\nSo while coach Fizdale got more games from his two stars, there was nearly no improvement in terms of success. \n\nNone of this is to say Fizdale is a terrible coach or that he can't become a great coach but if we look at his season with the Grizzlies, there's no reason to consider him a great coach as of right now. He was a rookie coach and he did a good job for a rookie. But nothing suggest he should be treated like a great coach. I realize not every coach is going to be someone like Brad Stevens and that's okay but from the reaction of many from this sub and many media personalities, you would think Fizdale was some prodigy coach.

Theoretically, Melo could've played more as a PF, set picks, pop out, etc...a bit undersized but similar to how Amare played on the Suns. But Melo is notorious for setting shitty picks (he almost always slips and posts up at the elbow), and even when they did run a successful pick, Melo would get the ball and slow the offense to his own pace, rendering Lin useless for that possession.

This piece of shit has really struggled to score this year, and could be considered the worst player on the magic. \n\n10 ppg: Markieff Morris. Not a great year for the Morris Bros.
