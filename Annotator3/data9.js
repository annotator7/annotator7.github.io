The hate was he never won the championship, but he made 3 stars out of 2 #9 draft picks and a FA guard Mark Cuban let go to sign Eric Dampier. He had to deal with an owner who sold draft picks and won\u2019t re-sign Joe Johnson. No other coach couldve coached that team to WCFs but he made things work.\n\nI admit I used to hate him too cause he made mincemeat of JVGs vaunted Rockets defense. The Suns always killed the Rockets those days and I never understood how they keep getting open shots. It\u2019s only later when I learned the nuances and started appreciating his philosophy."}, {"id": "dqs4hvd", "body": "Well said. D'Antoni was revolutionary. A coach that emphasized skill and versatility. He took a guy like Boris Diaw, who was an uknown, and I believe actually a shooting guard when he entered the league and made him into this triple double machine at center. Mind you Diaw is like 6'8 and everyone thought D'Antoni lost his damn mind. This was in an era where low post big man where the cornerstones of NBA franchises. The era of Shaq, KG, Dirk, Duncan, etc.. He also almost took them to the finals that one year when Amare was OUT the entire season!!
