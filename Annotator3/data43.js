Since the game he's missed vs toronto he's 29ppg on 54-50-87 (mostly with the mask). Earlier in the season, I def agree he didn't belong in the convo (when some put him over harden it was egregious) but now I think it's ok to put him top 5-6. The media will gas him up and put him top 3 based off narrative but I think it's not that big of a deal now. I do agree with you though.
