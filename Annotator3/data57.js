Hope he'll be back for the Rockets.\n\nStill no Draymond/Pachulia/Shaun, and now we had Dre to that, we have no facilitators at all, we're gonna need some better shooting than against the Lakers. Cook in the starting five.\n\nI don't like when we play the Grizzlies man, even when they're struggling, their style of basketball will always cause us trouble it seems, mainly due to Gasol to be honest.\n\nThoughts on the game : \n\n* Steve is using a timeout after only 3 minutes, doesn't like what he sees on offense and I'm with him on this one. You can already see the lack of anyone that can run the offense, it is static, slow, no one seems to know his role. Can't blame them that much, that line-up barely played with each other if ever.\n\n* Lots of Dubs fan like to criticize JaVale's defense, but during these first few minutes, he's guarding Gasol as good as one can. Kerr's timeout was effective, better hustle and effort than in the first few minutes.\n\n* Kevon Looney is in early. I'm interested to see what he can do on Gasol on the defensive end. Grizzlies offense is running very smoothly, their ball movement is as good as the last time we faced them.\n\n* Memphis can't seem to miss any threes. We're given them way too much opportunity to make them though. So many TOs, their defense is suffocating and some players aren't taking enough care of the ball.\n\n* 24-28, We finished the quarter a little bit better but we're still not finding any rythm offensively, except for Klay. I'm liking what I see on the other end, we're putting an emphasis on playing great defense this past couple games.\n\n* Klay was due to a Supernova game, and it might be tonight, 9/9 from the field already, he can't miss. Grizzlies are keeping up the pace, but our defense is getting tighter and tighter.\n\n* Our ball movement with Casspi on the floor is way better than at the start of the game. Also, even if he's not hitting his shot, he's hustling on every single play. Bell is playing some great D on Gasol.\n\n* 56-51, Dubs are shooting near 60% and playing great defense. 18 assists on 21 made field goals is amazing. I was skeptical we could run the offense at the start of the game but it's going fine. I wouldn't count Memphis out yet though.\n\n* Dubs are coming out off the locker room still really disciplined and focused on D. Grizzlies are therefore not finding their rythm. Loving that Bell/McGee connection. \n\n* Grizzlies starting the double team on KD early and not letting Klay open on the other side of the floor. It worked for two possessions but Cook made a three the third time.\n\n* Lots of possessions are going to the last 5 seconds or less, defenses are on point in the third quarter, no one can get open it seems, only tough shots.\n\n* 74-65, Defense is the key word for this quarter. KD is having another off night shooting wise by his own standards, Klay is fantastic tonight. I'm loving that we see more of the defensive side of the Dubs these past few games.\n\n* Pat McCaw's only field goal is a put-back dunk with a hand in his face, as we all could've predicted before this game. Loved his hustle tonight.\n\n* Nothing much to say about this quarter, it's basically the same for all game, great defense on both sides. But damn, the Dubs defense is amazing tonight, we're not letting them breathe.\n\n* This game was won steadily, we didn't go on crazy runs, we were good to great on defense the entire game except for the first few minutes. Bench was once again great.\n\n* The ball movement tonight was way better than I would've thought when I saw the injury list. Casspi/West brought the playmaking that we were lacking in the starting line-up, still way too much TOs. GG Grizzlies brs.\n\nOverall, a great defensive display by the Dubs, I'm aware Memphis isn't the most talented team in the league offensively, but I really liked the effort tonight. Many times this season the Warriors were being complacent against \"lesser\" teams, not tonight.\n\nNext game is the Lakers again, but at home this time"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7laskl", "body": "Here is a place to have in depth, x's and o's, discussions on yesterday's games.

ZBO and Trill were just either too big or too agile for us to defend at the start\n\ngot pretty deflating that we never got the stop needed or the go ahead bucket in the 3rd or the 4th. There were a couple threes from Crabbe which would've either given us the lead or gotten us back into the game much sooner, and it's pretty frustrating to see him brick wide open look time after time. Shooters shoot tho, and only way to break out of a slump, game or season-wide is to keep shooting. \n\nShot selection is kinda tied to playmaking, and both of those kinda devolve into shitty pnr's and iso's once we get to close games, and it's annoying because even without D'lo and Lin we should be able to run a coherent offense all the time. there's no reason that we should be able to do this the first 43 minutes of the game and not the last 5. A lot of this I can either pin on Kenny or whoever's directing traffic during these last couple bits, because the inbounds plays and just pace in general is usually pretty bad during those parts. Dinwiddie is a lot better than D'Lo at controlling the overall pace, but he hasn't been doing it that as well as he did during that hot streak earlier this year.

But when people claim all of his points are off flops and discredit everything he does don\u2019t you see why? Tonight was a good example. He had 12 points off free throws. I know 8 of those attempts were from getting fouled on two legit 3\u2019s, a tech, an and1. And another 2 from a legit foul on the drive. Only saw 2 FTA from a BS hook he did on Roberson. \n\nI like to the think I stay pretty calm but the average fan who gets shit on non stop might not be able to, especially when people are just spouting false nonsense. I saw a good chunk of fans calling MDA and Houston \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cpussies that deserve to lose\u201d for hacking Roberson like we invented it. It happened to us all the time with Dwight and Capela but now that Houston does it it\u2019s the worst thing in the world (it is lame btw, but it is strategy) \n\nI don\u2019t mind criticism when it\u2019s at least factual and arguable.

This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc. Bballbreakdown has a good analysis of this which you can read [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/11/16/bulls-pistons-cavaliers-bucks-pacers/) . [And for a more visual example of what I\u2019m talking about](https://gfycat.com/AcceptableHilariousFirebelliedtoad)\n\n*Defensive Hustle:*\n\nRobin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of blocks, Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of steals, and yet, Robin Lopez is still a valuable player to have on defense and can be a valuable anchor to a defense in need of a good defensive center. \n\nRobin Lopez contests shots. Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford. Last season, averaging 16.1 contests per game, he led the league in contesting shots. He may not get blocks but Lopez utilizes his positioning and defense to make sure that the opposing team doesn\u2019t get an easy shot from within the line and does this while also helping out with what will be discussed next, hustling off the glass. \n\n*Hustle off the Glass:*\n\nThis is one of the most important aspects of RoLo\u2019s game: he makes the players around him better. Unlike LeBron or other passers who do so on the offensive end of the game, RoLo makes players around him better on the defensive end: specifically in defensive rebounding. The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards. For some footage, check out [this](https://gfycat.com/MadeupUncomfortableGalapagostortoise)\n\nThis is why we see bigs who play with Lopez see jumps in their rebounding numbers while playing with Lopez and then those numbers regress when Lopez is gone. The best example of this? LeMarcus Aldridge. When did LMA play with Robin Lopez? The 13-14 and the 14-15 season. Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it. [\u2026] He does so many things that people don\u2019t notice. He\u2019s a hard worker. That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6b3fr", "body": "Sounds like you the campaign manager for Robin."}, {"id": "dr6b3fr", "body": "Sounds like you the campaign manager for Robin."}, {"id": "dr6bafl", "body": "RoLo is too good for our team and he deserves to be on a contender.

That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6b5je", "body": "Nah we good"}, {"id": "dr6b5je", "body": "Nah we good"}, {"id": "dr6bpnz", "body": "relevant username"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7jgzin", "body": "With the Bulls on a 3 game winning streak and reports coming out that the Chicago Bulls are shopping both Lopez and Mirotic, I think it\u2019s a good time to discuss Robin Lopez and why your team should consider trading for Lopez. \n\n**Hustle, hustle, and hustle**\n\nRobin Lopez\u2019s value comes a large part from his hustle plays, and his main hustle plays can be divided into 3 aspects: Offensive hustle, defensive hustle, and hustle off the glass. \n\n*Offensive hustle:* \n\nOne of the main strengths of Robin Lopez is what he offers for an offense, especially an offense which is reliant on pick and rolls or pick and pops. This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc. Bballbreakdown has a good analysis of this which you can read [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/11/16/bulls-pistons-cavaliers-bucks-pacers/) . [And for a more visual example of what I\u2019m talking about](https://gfycat.com/AcceptableHilariousFirebelliedtoad)\n\n*Defensive Hustle:*\n\nRobin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of blocks, Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of steals, and yet, Robin Lopez is still a valuable player to have on defense and can be a valuable anchor to a defense in need of a good defensive center. \n\nRobin Lopez contests shots. Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford. Last season, averaging 16.1 contests per game, he led the league in contesting shots. He may not get blocks but Lopez utilizes his positioning and defense to make sure that the opposing team doesn\u2019t get an easy shot from within the line and does this while also helping out with what will be discussed next, hustling off the glass. \n\n*Hustle off the Glass:*\n\nThis is one of the most important aspects of RoLo\u2019s game: he makes the players around him better. Unlike LeBron or other passers who do so on the offensive end of the game, RoLo makes players around him better on the defensive end: specifically in defensive rebounding. The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards. For some footage, check out [this](https://gfycat.com/MadeupUncomfortableGalapagostortoise)\n\nThis is why we see bigs who play with Lopez see jumps in their rebounding numbers while playing with Lopez and then those numbers regress when Lopez is gone. The best example of this? LeMarcus Aldridge. When did LMA play with Robin Lopez? The 13-14 and the 14-15 season. Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it.

[And for a more visual example of what I\u2019m talking about](https://gfycat.com/AcceptableHilariousFirebelliedtoad)\n\n*Defensive Hustle:*\n\nRobin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of blocks, Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of steals, and yet, Robin Lopez is still a valuable player to have on defense and can be a valuable anchor to a defense in need of a good defensive center. \n\nRobin Lopez contests shots. Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford. Last season, averaging 16.1 contests per game, he led the league in contesting shots. He may not get blocks but Lopez utilizes his positioning and defense to make sure that the opposing team doesn\u2019t get an easy shot from within the line and does this while also helping out with what will be discussed next, hustling off the glass. \n\n*Hustle off the Glass:*\n\nThis is one of the most important aspects of RoLo\u2019s game: he makes the players around him better. Unlike LeBron or other passers who do so on the offensive end of the game, RoLo makes players around him better on the defensive end: specifically in defensive rebounding. The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards. For some footage, check out [this](https://gfycat.com/MadeupUncomfortableGalapagostortoise)\n\nThis is why we see bigs who play with Lopez see jumps in their rebounding numbers while playing with Lopez and then those numbers regress when Lopez is gone. The best example of this? LeMarcus Aldridge. When did LMA play with Robin Lopez? The 13-14 and the 14-15 season. Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it. [\u2026] He does so many things that people don\u2019t notice. He\u2019s a hard worker. That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6b9fc", "body": "Trade you Henson and Delly for him. 2 players for 1, how can you say no to that?"}, {"id": "dr6b9fc", "body": "Trade you Henson and Delly for him. 2 players for 1, how can you say no to that?"}, {"id": "dr6esmu", "body": "What picks would you be willing to attach?

This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc.

The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards. For some footage, check out [this](https://gfycat.com/MadeupUncomfortableGalapagostortoise)\n\nThis is why we see bigs who play with Lopez see jumps in their rebounding numbers while playing with Lopez and then those numbers regress when Lopez is gone. The best example of this? LeMarcus Aldridge. When did LMA play with Robin Lopez? The 13-14 and the 14-15 season. Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it. [\u2026] He does so many things that people don\u2019t notice. He\u2019s a hard worker. That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6c2nh", "body": "We'll give you Jerryd Bayless.

This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc. Bballbreakdown has a good analysis of this which you can read [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/11/16/bulls-pistons-cavaliers-bucks-pacers/) .

Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford.

Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it. [\u2026] He does so many things that people don\u2019t notice. He\u2019s a hard worker. That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6e1eu", "body": "As a Laker fan I would love to have Robin and Brook.

This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc. Bballbreakdown has a good analysis of this which you can read [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/11/16/bulls-pistons-cavaliers-bucks-pacers/) . [And for a more visual example of what I\u2019m talking about](https://gfycat.com/AcceptableHilariousFirebelliedtoad)\n\n*Defensive Hustle:*\n\nRobin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of blocks, Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of steals, and yet, Robin Lopez is still a valuable player to have on defense and can be a valuable anchor to a defense in need of a good defensive center. \n\nRobin Lopez contests shots. Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford. Last season, averaging 16.1 contests per game, he led the league in contesting shots. He may not get blocks but Lopez utilizes his positioning and defense to make sure that the opposing team doesn\u2019t get an easy shot from within the line and does this while also helping out with what will be discussed next, hustling off the glass. \n\n*Hustle off the Glass:*\n\nThis is one of the most important aspects of RoLo\u2019s game: he makes the players around him better. Unlike LeBron or other passers who do so on the offensive end of the game, RoLo makes players around him better on the defensive end: specifically in defensive rebounding. The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards.

That guy does so many things that nobody else does on the first unit.\u201d \n\n**Offensive contributions**\n\nDespite Robin Lopez\u2019s main contributions coming from his hustle, you can\u2019t ignore Robin Lopez\u2019s offense, more specifically, the spacing and versatility he offers. \n\nFrom a post player perspective, RoLo is solid but not remarkable. He plays very much like a traditional center, back to the basket post ups to lay ups or his patented baby hook.\n\nWhere RoLo becomes really valuable as a center is in his midrange game and the spacing it provides. RoLo has a killer jump shot from around the free throw line and the elbow, and you can best see this in [games 1 and 2 of the playoff series against Boston last year.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gcZ290rfro)\n\n[Another great example of this comes from the recent Hornet\u2019s game in OT. Dunn, driving on the bassline draws help defense from Howard, leaving Lopez open near the elbow. Dunn dishes out to RoLo and Howard, not respecting Lopez decides to fall back to the paint rather than go and contest the shot, allowing RoLo for an easy midrange jumper which is one of his main offensive tools](https://youtu.be/9jaPahkpf-k?t=8m54s)\n\nIt\u2019s play like these, where they will run a PnR where RoLo will only roll halfway and stop at the free throw line and go for a high quality jumper, roll fully to the rim for a lay up or a baby hook etc and the versatility RoLo provides offensively that makes it impossible for rim protecting centers to settle into the paint and forces them to come forward to guard RoLo, opening up the paint for drives or passes to cutting players, a fact that David Nwaba has recently learned to exploit to great effect. \n\nAnother aspect that may make RoLo valuable to any team is that while he provides such offensive tools, he also may alleviate some pain of teams who are targeted by hack-a-player tactics. Robin Lopez shoots a respectable 76% from the charity strip, making it very difficult for teams to run a hack-a-Lopez tactics and it being effective thus allowing him to be a valuable back up to a star center who suffers from such tactics. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRobin Lopez isn\u2019t a superstar, and you\u2019d be hard pressed to call him a star. He\u2019s a role player, but a solid role players at that and if anything that\u2019s exactly what he strives for. In speaking to Rob Mahoney on the Breakaway podcast, Lopez said about his experience playing on a high school team with Brook, Quincy Pondexter, and two other players that went to play in college, \u201cI knew that there was only so much basketball to go around and for us to be successful, there had to be players on the team that sacrificed a little bit and embraced whatever role they had. I know I'm a role player. I know I'm supposed to go out there, I'm supposed to play some defense, be a rim protector, get some boards, offensive boards, set some good screens for guys who are going to go put the ball in the bucket.\u201d \n\nAs a role player, Robin Lopez offers defensive rebounding, strong and solid screens, strong fundamentals in defense, and a versatile offensive toolset which can be valuable any and every team. \n\nStats quoted come from a combination of NBA.com, basketball-reference.com, and cleaningtheglass.com\n\nGfycat credits go to Stephen Noh of The Athletic.\n"}, {"id": "dr6gtai", "body": "I'll give you one Tristan Thompson"}, {"id": "dr6gtai", "body": "I'll give you one Tristan Thompson"}, {"id": "dr6lfp8", "body": "Talk other bad contracts and the nets pick and maybe"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "Chain_ends", "body": "Chain_ends"}, {"id": "7jgzin", "body": "With the Bulls on a 3 game winning streak and reports coming out that the Chicago Bulls are shopping both Lopez and Mirotic, I think it\u2019s a good time to discuss Robin Lopez and why your team should consider trading for Lopez. \n\n**Hustle, hustle, and hustle**\n\nRobin Lopez\u2019s value comes a large part from his hustle plays, and his main hustle plays can be divided into 3 aspects: Offensive hustle, defensive hustle, and hustle off the glass. \n\n*Offensive hustle:* \n\nOne of the main strengths of Robin Lopez is what he offers for an offense, especially an offense which is reliant on pick and rolls or pick and pops. This is mainly because of his ability to set good and solid screens. Robin Lopez currently is 8th in the league in screen assists at 4 SAPG, falling behind only to centers in extremely PnR heavy offensive systems (Gortat, Drummond, Gobert, Adams, Vucevic, Len, and Chandler). What makes Robin Lopez\u2019s screens so valuable is just how much of a brick wall he sets up, and we can see this with how he opens up Markkanen. \n\nMarkkanen, despite being a stretch 4, is currently not playing like a stereotypical stretch 4 from behind the line. More specifically he\u2019s not been able to shoot from the corners, a staple of stretch 4s and a location, funny enough, that another stretch 4 on our team (Mirotic) has strived at. Currently, he\u2019s shooting less than 15% of his total 3 pointers from the corners and a large reason for that is that he has primarily focused defensively from beyond the arc and that the Chicago Bulls largely lack playmakers who can draw extra defenders and open up Markkanen as before LaVine returns, he is the primary focus of the opposing team\u2019s defense (a good example of this is the Lakers game in which the Lakers utilized Kuzma and Ingram with extremely quick switches and double teams to shut him down). Lopez is valuable in that he has become central to most plays allowing Markkanen to get an open look at 3 through pick and pops and solid screening, thus allowing Markkanen to, albeit not in the corner, get semi-open or open looks from behind the arc at the elbow or the top of the arc. Bballbreakdown has a good analysis of this which you can read [here](https://bballbreakdown.com/2017/11/16/bulls-pistons-cavaliers-bucks-pacers/) . [And for a more visual example of what I\u2019m talking about](https://gfycat.com/AcceptableHilariousFirebelliedtoad)\n\n*Defensive Hustle:*\n\nRobin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of blocks, Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t record a lot of steals, and yet, Robin Lopez is still a valuable player to have on defense and can be a valuable anchor to a defense in need of a good defensive center. \n\nRobin Lopez contests shots. Currently, this season, he contests an average of 12.1 shots, coming 7th behind his brother Brook, KAT, Boogie, Gobert, Adams, and Horford. Last season, averaging 16.1 contests per game, he led the league in contesting shots. He may not get blocks but Lopez utilizes his positioning and defense to make sure that the opposing team doesn\u2019t get an easy shot from within the line and does this while also helping out with what will be discussed next, hustling off the glass. \n\n*Hustle off the Glass:*\n\nThis is one of the most important aspects of RoLo\u2019s game: he makes the players around him better. Unlike LeBron or other passers who do so on the offensive end of the game, RoLo makes players around him better on the defensive end: specifically in defensive rebounding. The Chicago Bulls currently are 8th in the league in defensive rebounding behind the Hornets, 76ers, GSW, Celtics, Lakers, Blazers, and Nets at 35.1 DRPG. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to be because of Robin Lopez, as he only averages 5.5 rebound per game this season, which is in line with his career numbers. If you look at the actual percentage of defensive rebounds grabbed by Lopez while on the floor, it\u2019s around 11%. Then why is Lopez so important for making a team better at defensive rebounding when he doesn\u2019t do it himself?\n\nThe answer is that he doesn\u2019t care about getting rebounds as long as his team does. Robin Lopez often doesn\u2019t even jump for a defensive rebound, rather choosing to box out the other team\u2019s bigs and clearing the paint for his teammates to grab the boards. For some footage, check out [this](https://gfycat.com/MadeupUncomfortableGalapagostortoise)\n\nThis is why we see bigs who play with Lopez see jumps in their rebounding numbers while playing with Lopez and then those numbers regress when Lopez is gone. The best example of this? LeMarcus Aldridge. When did LMA play with Robin Lopez? The 13-14 and the 14-15 season. Coincidentally, these are the only 2 seasons in LMA\u2019s career in which he recorded double digits in rebounding (11.1 and 10.2 respectively). Before playing with RoLo, LMA was averaging around 7.8 RPG, in his seasons playing with RoLo he jumped to averaging 10.7 RPG, in the seasons following playing with RoLo his rebounding regressed back to 7.9 RPG. RoLo, through his hustle, made LMA better, as he is currently doing with Markkanen\u2019s rebounding numbers who is sitting at 8.1 RPG despite not being known as a good rebounder, and LMA knew it. When Portland let RoLo go LMA was quoted as saying \u201cI don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it [pause], I don\u2019t like it. I can\u2019t get past I don\u2019t like it.
