Honestly, I think Fultz is a bust but it's not entirely his fault. I think the Sixers coaches mucked up his shooting form and now they're reaping what they sewed. Joel Embiid is looking like a budding superstar and if Ben Simmons develops a better jumpshot not only will he be a better scorer but he will be a better playmaker because now the defense has to account for his shooting ability. The Sixers have 1st round picks for at least the next 4 years so they will be able to draft more talent to surround Simmons and Embiid and craft a team that can compete in the East. It will also help when LeBron retires. \n\nConsensus: The Sixers are fine. Fultz is a bust. Embiid and Simmons will be good. They have incoming talent.
